This interplay has been the subject of a very successful European Science Foundation (ESF) programme entitled COSLAB (‘Cosmology in the Laboratory’) that ran from 2001 to 2006, itself built on an earlier ESF network called TOPDEF (‘Topological Defects: Non-equilibrium Field Theory in Particle Physics, Condensed Matter and Cosmology’). The articles presented in this issue of

In this manuscript we share our personal views on the major open problems in the field of correlated electron systems. We discuss some possible routes to make progress in this rich and fascinating field. This manuscript is the result of the vigorous discussions and deliberations that took place at Johns Hopkins University during a three-day workshop January 27, 28, and 29, 2020 that brought together six senior scientists and 46 more junior scientists. Our hope, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies.},

The non-zero components of the SHG susceptibility in the ordered phase are derived from the symmetries of the susceptibility tensor in the high-temperature phase and the symmetry of the order parameter. In this derivation, the dependence of the SHG susceptibility on the order parameter follows naturally, and therefore its nonreciprocal optical properties. We examine this phenomenology for the magnetoelectric compound Cr2O3 as well as for the ferroelectromagnet YMnO3.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optical generation from a crystalline material can reveal the symmetries of both its lattice structure and underlying ordered electronic phases and can therefore be exploited as a complementary technique to diffraction based scattering probes. Although this technique has been successfully used to study the lattice and magnetic structures of systems such as semiconductor surfaces, multiferroic crystals, magnetic thin films, and multilayers, challenging technical requirements have prevented its application to the plethora of complex electronic phases found in strongly correlated electron systems. These requirements include an ability to probe small bulk single crystals at the μm length scale, a need for sensitivity to the entire nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor, oblique light incidence reflection geometry, and incident light frequency tunability among others. These measurements are further complicated by the need for extreme sample environments such as ultra low temperatures, high magnetic fields, or high pressures. In this review we present a novel experimental construction using a rotating light scattering plane that meets all the aforementioned requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by making symmetry measurements on a μm scale facet of a small bulk single crystal of Sr2IrO4 using optical second and third harmonic generation.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input ﬁles) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) deﬁning core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from ﬁrst principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We ﬁnd that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {This study examines wear phenomenon occurring in high-current density self-mated metal copper sliding contacts in humid carbon dioxide environments. A custom tribometer built to test macroscopic (lightly loaded) brush and slip-ring sliding electrical contacts at relatively high speed and current density is described in the text. Data is presented as further evidence that at some elevated current density (between 120 and 180 A/cm2) there is a transition in the wear mechanism as the brush wear rates, friction coefﬁcients, and contact resistances bifurcate. In situ white light interferometry provides new insight on the evolution of slip-ring surfaces as a function of current ﬂow direction through the contact. Ex situ SEM of the brush ﬁber bundle surfaces shows a strong dissimilitude in the wear of contacting ﬁbers as a result of the current ﬂow direction. Steady-state friction coefﬁcients in the range of 0.20–0.25, linear wear rates of 3–5 × 10−11 m/m, and contact resistances of 0.6 m are reported for copper ﬁber brushes in water saturated carbon dioxide environments at 2.5 m/s sliding speed and up to 120 A/cm2. A bifurcation occurs at 180 A/cm2 where the electron receiving brush (positive bias) exhibits an increase in friction coefﬁcient to a range of 0.3–0.4, and the electron donating brush (negative bias) a drop to 0.18. The positive brush also exhibits an increase in wear rate to 2.3 × 10−10 m/m and a sharp decrease in contact resistance to 0.2 m . The negative brush shows an increase in wear rate but only to half the value of the positive brush, and the negative brush contact resistance increased sharply to 0.6–0.8 m . An uncertainty analysis of wear rate is presented that demonstrates the need for long (100s of km) sliding distances to achieve a reasonable measurement uncertainty for such low wear contacts.},

	abstract = {The order parameter and its variations in space and time in many different states in condensed matter physics at low temperatures are described by the complex function C(r, t). These states include superfluids, superconductors, and a subclass of antiferromagnets and charge density waves. The collective fluctuations in the ordered state may then be categorized as oscillations of phase and amplitude of C(r, t). The phase oscillations are the Goldstone modes of the broken continuous symmetry. The amplitude modes, even at long wavelengths, are well defined and are decoupled from the phase oscillations only near particle-hole symmetry, where the equations of motion have an effective Lorentz symmetry, as in particle physics and if there are no significant avenues for decay into other excitations. They bear close correspondence with the so-called Higgs modes in particle physics, whose prediction and discovery are very important for the standard model of particle physics. In this review, we discuss the theory and the possible observation of the amplitude or Higgs modes in condensed matter physics—in superconductors, cold atoms in periodic lattices, and uniaxial antiferromagnets. We discuss the necessity for at least approximate particle-hole symmetry as well as the special conditions required to couple to such modes because, being scalars, they do not couple linearly to the usual condensed matter probes.},

The study of multiferroics dates back to the 1950s, but in recent years, key discoveries in theory, synthesis and characterization techniques have led to a new surge of interest in these materials. Different mechanisms, such as lone-pair, geometric, charge-ordering and spin-driven effects, can support multiferroicity. The general focus of the field is now shifting into neighbouring research areas, as we discuss in this Review. Multiferroic thin-film heterostructures, device architectures, and domain and interface effects are explored. The violation of spatial and inversion symmetry in multiferroic materials is a key feature because it determines their properties. Other aspects, such as the non-equilibrium dynamics of multiferroics, are underrated and should be included in the topics that will define the future of the field.},

Sections 1—8 provide a self.contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is requised except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6—8 include the approximate r{\textasciitilde}normalizationgroup recursion formula and the Feynman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10—13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; Sections 11—13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

	abstract = {The kagome superconductor CsV\$\_3\$Sb\$\_5\$ hosts a variety of charge density wave (CDW) phases, which play a fundamental role in the formation of other exotic electronic instabilities. However, identifying the precise structure of these CDW phases and their intricate relationships remain the subject of intense debate, due to the lack of static probes that can distinguish the CDW phases with identical spatial periodicity. Here, we unveil the competition between two coexisting \$2{\textbackslash}times2{\textbackslash}times2\$ CDWs in CsV\$\_3\$Sb\$\_5\$ harnessing time-resolved X-ray diffraction. By analyzing the light-induced changes in the intensity of CDW superlattice peaks, we demonstrate the presence of both phases, each displaying a significantly different amount of melting upon excitation. The anomalous light-induced sharpening of peak width further shows that the phase that is more resistant to photo-excitation exhibits an increase in domain size at the expense of the other, thereby showcasing a hallmark of phase competition. Our results not only shed light on the interplay between the multiple CDW phases in CsV\$\_3\$Sb\$\_5\$, but also establish a non-equilibrium framework for comprehending complex phase relationships that are challenging to disentangle using static techniques.},
