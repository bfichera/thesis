	abstract = {The 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 superstructure of 1T––TaSe2 at room temperature has been studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The basic structure has symmetry P 3m1 with a0 ¼ 3.4733  A and c0 ¼ 6.2715  A. The superstructure has a pseudo hexagonal lattice, but it is triclinic with a 169-fold, 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 Â 13c0 hexagonal supercell with 13 centering vectors. Structure refinements have been performed using space group P 1 and the primitive unit cell with a basal plane 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 supercell, and with C ¼ 2a0 þ c0. Refinements converged to RF ¼ 0.086 for 2327 observed reflections. Hexagram shaped clusters of 13 Ta atoms are the principle feature of this 13-fold superstructure, in accordance with the study of Brouwer and Jellinek (Physica B 99 (1980) 51). In the present refinement, significant deviations are found from local 6/m symmetry as it was assumed by Brouwer and Jellinek. The relative phase of the superstructure on neighbouring layers represents the most favourable packing of the buckled planes of Se atoms, and elastic coupling between Se atoms of consecutive layers is identified as the driving force for the observed inter-layer shift vector 2a0. The small deviations from trigonal symmetry of the clusters are responsible for the observation of an ordered superstructure, as it is opposed to a stacking of layers according a random selection of shift vectors (2a0, 2a0 þ b0, and Àa0 À 3b0) that are equivalent by the trigonal symmetry of the basic structure.},

	abstract = {Phase transitions in 2D materials can lead to massive changes in electronic properties that enable novel electronic devices. Tantalum disulﬁde (TaS2), speciﬁcally the “1T” phase (1T-TaS2), exhibits a phase transition based on the formation of commensurate charge density waves (CCDW) at 180 K. In this work, we investigate the impact of substrate choice on the phase transitions in ultrathin 1T-TaS2. Doping and charge transfer from the substrate has little impact on CDW phase transitions. On the contrary, we demonstrated that substrate surface roughness is a primary extrinsic factor in CCDW transition temperature and hysteresis, where higher roughness leads to smaller transition hysteresis. Such roughness can be simulated via surface texturing of SiO2/Si substrates, which controllably and reproducibly induces periodic strain in the 1TTaS2 and thereby enables the potential for engineering CDW phase transitions.},

	abstract = {The band structure, density of states and anisotropic frequency-dependent optical properties have been calculated for the 1 T and 2 H phases of TaS2 and TaSe2 using the full-potential linear augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) method. In the 1 T and 2 H phases, when S is replaced by Se, the unoccupied Ta-5d and chalcogen-p bands move closer to the Fermi energy EF and the bandwidth of the chalcogen-s group decreases. Compared to the 1 T phase, in the 2 H phase the occupied/unoccupied bands move towards higher/lower energies with respect to EF. In the 1 T phase, when S is replaced by Se, the peak positions in the imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function  2ðoÞ move towards lower energies by 0.5 eV. The single peak at 6 eV in  2ðoÞ of the 1 T phase is split into two peaks in the 2 H phase. We make a detailed comparison of the frequency-dependent reﬂectivity and absorption coefﬁcient with the available experimental data. The linear mufﬁn tin orbital method within the atomic sphere approximation (LMTOASA) shows poor agreement with the experimental data while our FPLAPW results give excellent agreement with the experimental data suggesting that a better representation of the potential is essential for calculating optical properties accurately.},

	abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate abrupt, reversible switching of resistance in 1T-TaS2 using dc and pulsed sources, corresponding to an insulator-metal transition between the insulating Mott and equilibrium metallic states. This transition occurs at a constant critical resistivity of 7 mohm-cm regardless of temperature or bias conditions and the transition time is signiﬁcantly smaller than abrupt transitions by avalanche breakdown in other small gap Mott insulating materials. Furthermore, this critical resistivity corresponds to a carrier density of 4.5 × 1019 cm-3, which compares well with the critical carrier density for the commensurate to nearly commensurate charge density wave transition. These results suggest that the transition is facilitated by a carrier driven collapse of the Mott gap in 1T-TaS2, which results in fast (3 ns) switching.},

The basic models behind charge-density-wave formation in low-dimensional solids are recapitulated, the experimental and theoretical results for the three selected compounds are reviewed, and their band structures and spectral weight distributions in the commensurate charge-density-wave phases are calculated using an empirical tight-binding model. It is explored whether the origin of charge-density waves in the layered transition-metal dichalcogenides can be understood in a uniﬁed way on the basis of a few measured and calculated parameters characterizing the interacting electron–lattice system. It is found that the predictions of the standard mean-ﬁeld model agree only semi-quantitatively with the experimental data and that there is not one generally dominant factor driving charge-density-wave formation in this family of layer compounds. The need for further experimental and theoretical scrutiny is emphasized.},

These waves are incommensurate with the matrix in lT, and lT,, but form a commensurate superlattice in lT,. Within lT,, the temperature dependence of the wave vector is correlated with a change in the cross-section of the Fermi surface, while the diffuse scattering which accompanies the discrete reflexions in lT, is discussed as a n image of this surface in the phonon spectrum.

This study revealed that noise in 1T-TaS2 has two pronounced maxima at the bias voltages, which correspond to the onset of CDW sliding and the NC-to-IC phase transition. We observed unusual Lorentzian features and exceptionally strong noise dependence on electric bias and temperature, leading to the conclusion that electronic noise in 2D CDW systems has a unique physical origin diﬀerent from known fundamental noise types. We argue that noise spectroscopy can serve as a useful tool for understanding electronic transport phenomena in 2D CDW materials characterized by coexistence of diﬀerent phases and strong pinning.},

The primary aim here is to present the diffraction evidence from electron, X-ray, and neutron observations for the adoption of a charge density wave ground state coupled to a periodic lattice distortion and to show how this ground state may be perturbed by substitutional doping and intercalation. The electronic consequences of these effects are then briefly reviewed.},

	abstract = {Using temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy we address the question of how the transition from bulk to few atomic layers aﬀects the charge density wave (CDW) phases in 1T-TaS2. We ﬁnd that for crystals with thickness larger than ≈ 10nm the transition temperatures between the diﬀerent phases as well as the hysteresis that occurs in the thermal cycle correspond to the ones expected for a bulk sample. However, when the crystals become thinner than ≈ 10nm, the commensurate CDW phase is suppressed down to the experimentally accessible temperatures. In addition, the nearly commensurate CDW phase is diminished below ≈ 4nm. These ﬁndings suggest that the interlayer coupling plays a signiﬁcant role in determining the properties of CDW systems consisting of a few unit cells in the vertical direction.},

Here, using large-area scanning tunneling microscopy we reveal an intricate chiral vortex structure and complex tiling of charged electron domains in the metastable metallic state in 1T-TaS2 created by a non-equilibrium topological transition initiated by a single femtosecond optical pulse. A Moir´e analysis shows that the interference of non-equilibrium nested Fermi surface (FS) electrons leads to the creation of charge vortices D on a length scale of ∼70 nm. On a much smaller scale of ∼ 5 nm, domain conﬁgurational patterns appear, which show bound vortex-antivortex pairs, discommensurations, domain wall (DW) crossings and DW kinks, consistent with a rapidly quenched Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Revealing the detailed mechanism for the transition leads the way to design of long-range charge-ordered metastable states with intricate emergent properties under controlled non-equilibrium conditions.},

The ability to locally write and erase DWs is highly desirable, as it allows one to design material functionality by patterning DWs in specific configurations. We demonstrate such capability at room temperature in a charge density wave (CDW), a macroscopic condensate of electrons and phonons, in ultrathin 1T-TaS2. A single femtosecond light pulse is shown to locally inject or remove mirror DWs in the CDW condensate, with probabilities tunable by pulse energy and temperature. Using time-resolved electron diffraction, we are able to simultaneously track anti-synchronized CDW amplitude oscillations from both the lattice and the condensate, where photoinjected DWs lead to a red-shifted frequency. Our demonstration of reversible DW manipulation may pave new ways for engineering correlated material systems with light.},

The method directly measures the nth harmonics of the scanning frequency corresponding to SHG signal components of Cn symmetry that appear in a Fourier series expansion of a general RA-SHG signal. GaAs was used as a test sample allowing comparison of point-by-point averaging with the lock-in based method. When divided by the C\&\#x0221E; signal component, the lock-in detected data allowed for both self-referenced determination of ratios of Cn components of up to 1 part in 104 and significantly more sensitive measurement of the relative amount of different Cn components when compared with conventional methods.},
