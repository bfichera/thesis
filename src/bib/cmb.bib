	abstract = {We study the interplay between electronic correlations and hybridization in the low-energy electronic structure of CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$, a candidate hybridization-gap semiconductor. Utilizing state-of-the-art advanced density functionals we find both the antiferromagnetic N{\textbackslash}'eel order and band gap in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. We further find that, under hydrostatic pressure, the band gap is mainly governed by magnetic correlations, whereas hybridization has a greater impact on states at higher band energies. This result suggests that CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$ is more closely related to the high-temperature superconducting cuprates and iron pnictides than the heavy fermion class of materials. Finally, we also find the antiferromagnetic CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$ to be topologically trivial for all pressures studied.},

	abstract = {In three different antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials we show that the magnetization dynamics of AFM compounds differs noticeably from that of ferromagnetic compounds. Optical second harmonic generation and linear reﬂection were used to monitor with a temporal resolution of {\textless}1 ps the evolution of the AFM order parameter subsequent to an intense optical excitation. Comparison of the dynamical properties of the model antiferromagnet Cr2O3 with model ferro- and ferrimagnets reveals that spin–lattice relaxation as the temporally limiting thermalization process of the magnetic subsystem is more complex and inherently faster than in compounds displaying a spontaneous magnetization. The exchange-bias compound NiO exhibits an ultrafast photoinduced AFM phase transition in the course of which the AFM order parameter is switched by 90◦. Properly timed sequences of pump pulses can repeatedly reorient the AFM order parameter within 10 ps, thus demonstrating ultrafast AFM switching. In the colossal-magnetoresistance compound Pr1−xCaxMnO3 optical pumping triggers a transition from an insulating AFM to a conducting metallic state within 230 fs.},

In this paper we present theoretical study of the nonlinear conductivity in odd-parity magnetic multipole ordered systems whose \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{PT\}\$-symmetry is essentially distinct from the previously studied acentric systems. Combining microscopic formulation and symmetry analysis, we classify the nonlinear responses in the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{PT\}\$-symmetric systems as well as \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$-symmetric (non-magnetic) systems, and uncover nonlinear conductivity unique to the odd-parity magnetic multipole systems. A giant nonlinear Hall effect, nematicity-assisted dichroism and magnetically-induced Berry curvature dipole effect are proposed and demonstrated in a model for Mn-based magnets.},

              One of the most intriguing features of some high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the interplay between one-dimensional “striped” spin order and charge order, and superconductivity.

This places stringent new constraints on our understanding of stripe order and its relation to superconductivity.},

              is widely considered to be a topological Weyl semimetal, with evidence for momentum-space monopoles of Berry curvature from transport and spectroscopic probes. As the bandstructure is highly sensitive to the magnetic order, attention has focused on anomalies in magnetization, susceptibility and transport measurements that are seen well below the Curie temperature, leading to speculation that a “hidden” phase coexists with ferromagnetism. Here we report spatially-resolved measurements by Kerr effect microscopy that identify this phase. We find that the anomalies coincide with a deep minimum in domain wall (DW) mobility, indicating a crossover between two regimes of DW propagation. We demonstrate that this crossover is a manifestation of a 2D phase transition that occurs within the DW, in which the magnetization texture changes from continuous rotation to unidirectional variation. We propose that the existence of this 2D transition deep within the ferromagnetic state of the bulk is a consequence of a giant quality factor for magnetocrystalline anisotropy unique to this compound. This work broadens the horizon of the conventional binary classification of DWs into Bloch and Néel walls, and suggests new strategies for manipulation of domain walls and their role in electron and spin transport.},

              Efficient manipulation of antiferromagnetic (AF) domains and domain walls has opened up new avenues of research towards ultrafast, high-density spintronic devices. AF domain structures are known to be sensitive to magnetoelastic effects, but the microscopic interplay of crystalline defects, strain and magnetic ordering remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal, using photoemission electron microscopy combined with scanning X-ray diffraction imaging and micromagnetic simulations, that the AF domain structure in CuMnAs thin films is dominated by nanoscale structural twin defects. We demonstrate that microtwin defects, which develop across the entire thickness of the film and terminate on the surface as characteristic lines, determine the location and orientation of 180

This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions—spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital—are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.},

              Magneto-optical memory storage media, such as hard drives, use magnetic fields to change the magnetization of memory bits, but the process is slow. Light can often reveal information about the magnetization state of a sample, such as its field direction. Lambert
              et al.
              show that under the right circumstances, light can also switch the magnetization state of a thin ferromagnetic film. Using light pulses instead of magnetic fields led to ultrafast data memory and data storage.

            The all-optical control of magnetization in thin ferromagnetic films is demonstrated.
          , 
            The interplay of light and magnetism allowed light to be used as a probe of magnetic materials. Now the focus has shifted to use polarized light to alter or manipulate magnetism. Here, we demonstrate optical control of ferromagnetic materials ranging from magnetic thin films to multilayers and even granular films being explored for ultra-high-density magnetic recording. Our finding shows that optical control of magnetic materials is a much more general phenomenon than previously assumed and may have a major impact on data memory and storage industries through the integration of optical control of ferromagnetic bits.},

Far from the nodes, pumping affected the gap only weakly, and recombination processes were faster.
