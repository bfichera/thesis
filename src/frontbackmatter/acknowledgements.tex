I owe a huge debt to my advisor, Nuh Gedik, for all of his support throughout my Ph.D.
Not only is Nuh a brilliant scientist, he is also extremely kind to his students, demonstrating a level of compassion far beyond, I think, what is typical for Ph.D. advisors in Physics.
None of the research in this thesis would have been possible without that.

I would also like to thank my undergraduate advisor, Jay Kikkawa, as well as Sebastian Hurtado Parra and Mehmet Noyan, who were graduate students in his group when I was there.
These were the one of the first people in my career who decided to believe in me (based on what, I don't know), and for that I am extremely grateful.
They are also all excellent experimentalists; almost everything I know about doing research came from them.

Many thanks also to Joe Checkelsky and Liang Fu, who served on my committee and who I very much enjoyed chatting with during my Ph.D.
I am also grateful for the support of my academic advisor, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero.

Anshul Kogar was a postdoc in the Gedik group when I joined in \num{2017}, and took me under his wing when as I was building the initial experimental setup.
Anshul worked with me to tackle the many, many bugs in the setup---something that I think many postdocs would have left me to do on my own---and somehow kept an extremely chill disposition throughout the whole process.
He was also very kind to me when I was facing some health issues during my first and second years, which I am very grateful for.

Baiqing Lv joined the Gedik group a few years later, and was my officemate and mentor from then until he left in \num{2022}.
Baiqing and I worked jointly on almost all of the projects in this thesis, and he and I spent many hours discussing different interpretations for our results before we landed on the ones presented here.
More importantly, though, Baiqing was and is an excellent friend, and I am truly grateful to have met him.

Karna Morey and Zongqi Shen, two very perspicacious young people, joined the Gedik group at different times when I was a senior Ph.D. student and, like Anshul and Baiqing, helped me a lot with all of the projects presented in this thesis.
Without Karna, we would not have had the ability to automate the polarizers in the experimental setup, which was indisputably necessary for the \ce{CaMn2Bi2} and \ce{CuBr2} projects.
He and Zongqi were also responsible for taking much of the data for these projects when I was travelling or otherwise away from the lab.
After Karna graduated (and moved to Stanford for his Ph.D.), Zongqi joined the lab as a graduate student and has been working closely with me since then; in that time, he has not only learned all of the ins and outs of the experimental setup, but also launched a number of new projects which I am very excited to see pan out.
I am grateful to both of them not only for their help completing this research, but also for the opportunity to be their mentors, and for their patience as I learned how to do that.

I am also grateful to the rest of the Gedik group for all of their support during my Ph.D; it was truly a pleasure to come to an office every day that was filled with such amazing people, and to be able to enjoy their company throughout the day.
At many times they showed me kindness that they didn't need to---from helping me with experiments to taking me to the hospital when I broke my foot---which had a much greater impact than I think they know.

Thanks also to Monica Wolf, Gerry Miller, and Lars Llorente, who were essential in keeping CMX functional at MIT, and to Mike Maikowsky, for fixing our Spitfire many more times than should have been necessary.

To Mom, Dad, Alison, and Dylan, thank you for instilling in me a love for science, supporting my dreams, and for encouraging me to be the best version of myself that I can be.
Thanks also to Antonella, Ari, Julius, Lisa, and Mark for all of your support and for welcoming me into your family.

No amount of thanks is adequte (I'll try anyway) for all of my friends, especially Will, Cliff, Kalina, Hope, Abe, Jeff, and Rachel; I have no right to have so many amazing people in my life, but I do, and I'm very grateful for you.

Thank you to all of the workers who make life in Boston possible, especially the employees at Chipotle, Life Alive, and all the other killer lunch spots near the office, the custodial and facilities staffs at MIT, the employees at MIT Medical, and the workers and delivery drivers at the various restaurants around town that I would often get dinner from.

Finally, to Cami: thank you for coming with me on this wonderful adventure, for celebrating all of the smallest achievements with me, and for carrying me at times when I couldn't go any further on my own.
It has meant the world to me, and I only hope I can look out for you the same way you have for me.
