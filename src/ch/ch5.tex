\section{Abstract}

The notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking has been used to describe phase transitions in a variety of physical systems.
In crystalline solids, the breaking of certain symmetries, such as mirror symmetry, is difficult to detect unambiguously.
Using \tastwo, we demonstrate here that \gls{rashg} is not only a sensitive technique for the detection of broken mirror symmetry, but also that it can differentiate between mirror symmetry-broken structures of opposite planar chirality.
We also show that our analysis is applicable to a wide class of different materials with mirror symmetry-breaking transitions.
Lastly, we find evidence for bulk mirror symmetry-breaking in the incommensurate charge density wave phase of \tastwo.
Our results pave the way for \gls{rashg} to probe candidate materials where broken mirror symmetry may play a pivotal role.

\section{Introduction}

In condensed matter systems, phases are often classified by the symmetries that they break.
Identifying these symmetries enables one to understand a system's order parameter, collective excitations, topological defects, and allowable topological indices \citep{sethna, thouless}.
Together, these attributes allow one to predict how a material will respond to external perturbations like electromagnetic fields, heat, and mechanical forces, which is a central goal of condensed matter physics.

Specifically, the presence or absence of mirror symmetry can lead to a variety of unusual phases and properties.
For example, the absence of mirror plane symmetry in noncentrosymmetric materials can give rise to gyrotropic order, which can lead to a nonzero out-of-plane circular photo-galvanic effect \citep{belinicher1980}.
Moreover, in certain topological crystalline insulators, such as SnTe, the presence of mirror symmetry can give rise to conducting surface states through the existence of a nonzero mirror Chern number.
This topological index guarantees an even number of Dirac cones on surfaces where mirror symmetry is retained \citep{teo2008, hsieh_topological_2012, fu_topological_2011}.

In other circumstances, like that in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors, the existence of mirror symmetry is more controversial and has led some to seek an experimental method to serve as a binary indicator of broken mirror symmetry \citep{hlobil_elastoconductivity_2015}.
In principle, several tools can already do this, including resonant ultrasound spectroscopy \citep{leisure1997, migliori1993}, X-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction \citep{bacon1966, dorset2013}, and a recently-proposed method, shear conductivity \citep{hlobil_elastoconductivity_2015}.
Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy and the diffraction-based techniques are more sensitive to the ionic lattice, which makes the identification of subtle electronic symmetry-breaking challenging.
And while shear conductivity has the potential to be an extremely versatile tool for identifying broken point group symmetries, experimental pursuits are currently only preliminary \citep{hlobil_elastoconductivity_2015}.
In this study, we focus on a nonlinear optical technique, \gls{rashg}, which we show is capable not only of identifying broken mirror symmetry \citep{heinz_study_1985} but also of resolving its sense (left- or right-handed).
Furthermore, \gls{rashg} is sensitive to the electronic subsystem and can be used for microscopy studies, making it an ideal experimental tool for probing phase transitions where domains may arise \citep{kumar_magnetic_2017, harter_parity-breaking_2017}.

In this direction, we choose a material, \tastwo, in which vertical mirror plane symmetry is manifestly broken across an \gls{ic} to \gls{nc} \gls{cdw} transition \citep{wilson_charge-density_1975, zong_ultrafast_2018}.
Using this material, we demonstrate in this Rapid Communication that \gls{rashg} is an effective probe of broken mirror symmetry.
We also show that the sense (i.e. left- or right-handed) associated with the mirror symmetry-broken structure is encoded in the angular dependence of the \gls{rashg} signal.
Thus, \gls{rashg} can be used to differentiate mirror-opposite domains. 
While the data presented in this work is specific to the case of \tastwo, we also show analytically that our technique is applicable to a wide class of transitions involving spontaneously broken mirror symmetry.

\tastwo is a layered material with a crystallographic structure identical to other octahedrally-coordinated transition metal dichalcogenides (\cref{tastwo-fig:fig0a}).
The space group of the high temperature, undistorted phase is $P\bar{3}m1$ (no.164, point group $D_{3d}$)~\citep{spijkerman_x-ray_1997}, and the point group of the surface normal to the (001) direction in this phase is $C_{3v}$~\citep{scruby_role_1975, fung_application_1980}.
Upon lowering temperature, \tastwo undergoes a series of CDW transitions.
At $T_{\mathrm{IC}}=\qty{550}{K}$, a triple-$q$ \gls{ic} CDW forms which breaks translational symmetry but retains the surface point group symmetries of the undistorted phase~\citep{scruby_role_1975, fung_application_1980}.
The effects of the CDW on the bulk symmetries in this phase are not yet understood.
On further cooling, at $T_{\mathrm{IC-NC}}=\qty{353}{K}$ there is a weak first-order transition to an \gls{nc} CDW phase where three vertical mirror plane symmetries are broken~\citep{spijkerman_x-ray_1997} and the surface point group becomes $C_3$.
The \gls{nc} phase has been visualized with scanning tunneling microscopy and exhibits patches of commensurate ``Star of David" hexagrams that are separated by a network of discommensurations \citep{wu_hexagonal_1989}.
Because mirror symmetry is broken, there are two energetically equivalent CDW configurations ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) in the \gls{nc} phase that have opposite planar chirality (\crefrange{tastwo-fig:fig0c}{tastwo-fig:fig0d}).
At even lower temperatures, $T_{\mathrm{NC-C}}=\qty{184}{K}$, \tastwo undergoes a symmetry-preserving first-order transition, where the discommensurations disappear and the CDW locks into a structure commensurate with the underlying lattice~\citep{ishiguro_high-resolution_1995}.

Recent interest in the \gls{nc} phase of \tastwo has arisen due to the possibility of injecting mirror-opposite domains into the CDW structure \citep{zong_ultrafast_2018} which do not otherwise develop during the \gls{ic}-\gls{nc} transition.
Zong \textit{et al.} were able to induce these domains using a single ultrafast pulse of light, which was found to drive the material into a long-lived metastable state possessing domains of opposite planar chirality.
Partly motivated by the desire to image these domains, we seek here a simple experimental method that could identify domains with opposite planar chirality.

\section{Results and discussion}

\tastwo samples used in the experiment were grown using the chemical vapor transport technique, as described in Ref.~\citep{zong_ultrafast_2018}.
We verified that the \gls{nc} phase of \tastwo was single-domain by performing electron diffraction on a sample from the same batch (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}).
This is in agreement with previous works~\citep{zong_ultrafast_2018, wilson_charge-density_1975, bovet_pseudogapped_2004, shiba_phenomenological_1986}.

In \gls{rashg}~\citep{harter_high-speed_2015, lu_fast_2018, torchinsky_structural_2015, lu_fourier_2018}, a pulsed laser beam of frequency $\omega$ and amplitude $E(\omega)$ is focused onto a sample with nonzero angle of incidence $\theta$ (\cref{tastwo-fig:fig0b}).
The $2\omega$ component of the radiation emitted by the sample is subsequently measured in various combinations of incoming and outgoing polarizations (either parallel (P) or perpendicular (S) to the plane of incidence) and as a function of the angle $\phi$ between the plane of incidence and some crystallographic axis.
In noncentrosymmetric materials, the response is dominated by the bulk electric dipole moment $P_i(2\omega) = \chi_{ijk}E_j(\omega)E_k(\omega)$ \citep{boyd}, where $\chi_{ijk}$ is a material-specific susceptibility tensor which must be invariant under all symmetry operations present in the crystallographic point group.
In centrosymmetric crystals such as \tastwo, the bulk electric dipole response is forbidden~\citep{boyd, powell}.
In this case, the dominant response often comes from the surface of the sample, which necessarily breaks inversion symmetry~\citep{bloembergen_optical_1968}.
SHG from surfaces of materials is described by a different susceptibility tensor, $\chi_{ijk}^S$, which is constrained by the crystal symmetries of the surface.
In addition, there can be bulk contributions from higher-order processes which are allowed in the presence of inversion symmetry, such as the bulk quadrupole response $Q_{ij}(2\omega) = \chi^Q_{ijkl}E_k(\omega)E_l(\omega)$~\citep{kumar_magnetic_2017, shen}.
Our experimental implementation uses a fast-rotation setup similar to that described in \citet{harter_high-speed_2015} and \citet{torchinsky_low_2014}.
Here, we use an \qty{800}{nm} (\qty{1.55}{eV}) laser beam incident at $\ang{10}$ with respect to the (001) sample normal.
Further experimental details can be found in the supplement (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}).

To show that we are sensitive to the breaking of mirror symmetry across the \gls{ic} to \gls{nc} transition, we took \gls{rashg} data on \tastwo in both phases.
\Cref{tastwo-fig:fig1a,tastwo-fig:fig1b} show the second harmonic response from the sample above and below $T_{\mathrm{IC-NC}} = \qty{353}{K}$ in two polarization channels, plotted as a function of $\phi$.
We are able to fit the rotational anisotropy in the \gls{ic} phase using the surface point group $C_{3v}$ (\cref{tastwo-fig:fig1a}), which is in agreement with previous reports~\citep{scruby_role_1975, fung_application_1980}.
It should be noted that in order to fit the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel appropriately, we find that it is necessary to add an additional bulk quadrupole contribution to the signal.
The consequences of this contribution will be discussed later, but at the moment they do not affect our conclusions.

\end{enumerate*}
}
\end{figure}

Upon cooling into the \gls{nc} phase, mirror symmetry is spontaneously broken and the surface point group reduces to $C_3$~\citep{spijkerman_x-ray_1997}.
As a result, the \gls{rashg} exhibits a marked lowering of symmetry (\cref{tastwo-fig:fig1b}).
This lowering of symmetry can be understood by noting that the $\phi$ dependence of $I_\mathrm{PS}(2\omega)$ under $C_3$ is given by (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement})
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:intensityequation}
I_\mathrm{PS}(2\omega) = (A_0 + A_1\cos{(3\phi)} + A_2\sin{(3\phi)})^2,
\end{equation}
where $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_2$ are functions of the susceptibility elements $\chi^S_{ijk}$.

Symmetry considerations (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}) show that $A_0$ and $A_1$ vanish identically in the presence of mirror symmetry. The absence of these terms lead to the six-fold symmetry in the P$_{\mathrm{in}}$-S$_{\mathrm{out}}$ channel and its alignment with the crystallographic axes as seen in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig1a}.
However, these terms can adopt nonzero values when mirror symmetry is broken.
Below $T_{\mathrm{IC-NC}}$, the \gls{rashg} intensity therefore exhibits a three-fold rather than six-fold symmetric pattern, arising from a nonzero $A_0$. 
The effect of a nonzero $A_1$ is to rotate the \gls{rashg} intensity away from the high-symmetry axes, but we observe this coefficient to be zero within the resolution of our instrument.
A negligible rotation of the SHG pattern should be expected, as the atomic positions of the \ce{Ta} atoms only contract towards a central \ce{Ta} atom and do not rotate away from their high symmetry axes to break the mirror symmetry (see \crefrange{tastwo-fig:fig0c}{tastwo-fig:fig0d}).

The three-fold nature of the \gls{rashg} intensity can be quantified experimentally by performing a spectral (sine) decomposition of the intensity and extracting the third Fourier coefficient, $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}$, of $I_\mathrm{PS}(2\omega)$ (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}).
\Cref{tastwo-fig:fig1c} shows that $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}$ appears discontinuously below $T_{\mathrm{IC-NC}}$, consistent with the first-order nature of the phase transition.
Taken together, the above considerations confirm that $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}$ is a binary indicator of broken mirror symmetry in \tastwo.

Having established that \gls{rashg} is sensitive to the breaking of vertical mirror plane symmetry in \tastwo, we now seek to demonstrate that it can differentiate between CDW configurations of opposite planar chirality in the \gls{nc} phase.
To do so, we generate two samples with opposite planar chirality by cleaving a single sample of \tastwo.
We then perform \gls{rashg} on both sides of the same cleave.
Referring to \cref{tastwo-fig:fig0c,tastwo-fig:fig0d}, cleaving the sample is equivalent to performing a \ang{180} rotation about the $x$-axis, which in a single layer is equivalent to a mirror reflection about $M_{xz}$.

\Cref{tastwo-fig:fig2} shows the results of \gls{rashg} measurements in the P$_\mathrm{in}$-P$_\mathrm{out}$ and P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channels as functions of $\phi$, where the two mirror images are labeled $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
As shown in the figure, whether the CDW configuration was $\alpha$ or $\beta$ is indicated in \gls{rashg} by the orientation (up or down) of the pattern in the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel, which is determined by the sign of $A_0$ in \cref{tastwo-eq:intensityequation} (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}).
This feature constitutes an experimental observable capable of identifying the sense associated with broken mirror symmetry in \tastwo. 

To validate the analysis contained above, we first fit the data for the $\alpha$ structure using the surface point group $C_{3}$ to generate a tensor $\chi^\alpha_{ijk}$ with numerical coefficients.
The fit is shown in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig2a}.
Then, we transform $\chi^\alpha_{ijk}$ by a mirror reflection about $M_{xz}$ to generate $\chi_{ijk}^\beta$ (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}); with this transformation, we find that the rotational anisotropy simulated using $\chi_{ijk}^\beta$ collapses onto the measured signal, as shown in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig2b}.

While the data contained in this work is specific to \tastwo, the analysis is applicable to a variety of different phase transitions involving broken mirror symmetry.
By understanding which Fourier coefficients of the SHG intensity adopt nonzero values in the low-symmetry phase, one can show that almost every structural phase transition involving broken mirror symmetry implies a measurable change in the symmetry of the SHG pattern (i.e. beyond a simple change in overall intensity).
We have performed a symmetry analysis of all possible phase transitions involving spontaneously broken mirror symmetry and in each case identified the relevant experimental indicator(s).
The results of this analysis can be found in the supplement (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}).

The final observation of this work concerns the contribution from the bulk of the sample to the measured \gls{rashg} signal.
As mentioned above, we find that in order to fit the data in the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel correctly, we need to introduce an additional bulk quadrupole contribution to the SHG signal.
This contribution, which is described by the effective polarization $\nabla_j Q_{ij} = 2i\chi_{ijkl}^Qk_j E_k E_l$, is the next-lowest order contribution to SHG and is allowed in the presence of inversion symmetry~\citep{kumar_magnetic_2017, shen}.
Importantly, the quadrupole contribution is generated by the entire illumination volume and is therefore insensitive to the surface symmetry.
Quadrupole SHG can be identified by examining the $\theta$ dependence of the SHG intensity in the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel.
For purely electric dipole SHG, the symmetry in this channel does not depend on the incident angle.
The $\theta$ dependence depicted in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a,tastwo-fig:fig3b} therefore establishes the presence of a quadrupole contribution in our signal.

According to diffraction measurements~\citep{fung_application_1980}, the correct surface and bulk point groups in the \gls{nc} phase are $C_3$ and $S_6$, respectively.
\Cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a} shows our results in this phase, which are consistent with this assignment.
To understand the three-fold symmetry in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a}, we note that the $\phi$ dependence of $I_\mathrm{SS}(2\omega)$ in this symmetry assignment is given by (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement})
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:qintensityequation}
I_\mathrm{SS}(2\omega) = (B_0+B_1\cos{(3\phi)}+B_2\sin{(3\phi)})^2,
\end{equation}
where $B_1$ and $B_2$ are functions of the susceptibility elements $\chi^S_{ijk}$ and $\chi^Q_{ijkl}$, but $B_0$ depends on $\chi^Q_{ijkl}$ only (and is zero when the quadrupole contribution is ignored).
$B_0$ is then a probe of the bulk structure only and is not affected by the surface symmetry.
When mirror symmetry is broken, all three coefficients are allowed and the function is three-fold symmetric as in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a}.

\end{enumerate*}
}
\end{figure}

However, symmetry considerations (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}) show that $B_0$ is zero in the presence of mirror symmetry.
If bulk mirror symmetry were fully restored in the \gls{ic} phase, we would therefore expect the signal to be six-fold symmetric.
\Cref{tastwo-fig:fig3c} shows that the \gls{rashg} instead remains three-fold symmetric in this phase, suggesting that the bulk breaks mirror symmetry.
On the other hand, the highest-symmetry surface point group consistent with \cref{tastwo-fig:fig1a,tastwo-fig:fig3c} is $C_{3v}$, which retains mirror symmetry.
With \gls{rashg}, it is not possible to deduce the full crystal structure, but we speculate that this discrepancy between surface and bulk symmetries might be attributable to the particular stacking arrangement associated with the CDW above $T_{\mathrm{IC-NC}}$ (see \cref{tastwo-sec:supplement}).
This would explain why the surface component, which is measuring the local structure at the surface of the sample~\citep{bloembergen_optical_1968}, is consistent with the existence of mirror symmetry, whereas the bulk component, which measures the global structure of many layers, is not.

\section{Conclusion}

In summary, we have demonstrated here that \gls{rashg} can be used to identify broken mirror symmetry in crystalline materials.
In addition, we have found that \gls{rashg} can differentiate between structural configurations related by mirror reflection.
By considering the different symmetry constraints on the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel, we have also shown that \gls{rashg} is sensitive to broken mirror symmetry in the bulk of \tastwo, and have found evidence that the \gls{ic} phase of this material breaks mirror symmetry in the bulk.
Importantly, our analysis is generalizable beyond the specific case of \tastwo, and therefore opens up the possiblity for \gls{rashg} to detect mirror symmetry-broken phases and their domain structures in other candidate materials.

\subsubsection{Complete RA-SHG data\label{tastwo-sec:complete_a}}
In the first section of the main text, we discuss how \gls{rashg} is sensitive to the breaking of mirror symmetry in \tastwo.
In \cref{tastwo-fig:fig1,tastwo-fig:fig1b} of the main text, we display \gls{rashg} data in two polarization channels: P$_\mathrm{in}$-P$_\mathrm{out}$ and P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$.
For completeness, the other polarization channels are reproduced in \cref{tastwo-fig:figS1}.
Importantly, the fits in the figure only include a surface electric dipole contribution (see main text).
The inability to fit the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel with a pure electric dipole contribution suggested to us that a second contribution was necessary in the form of a bulk electric quadrupole term.
This is discussed in the main text as well as in \cref{tastwo-sec:Squadrupole}.

\subsubsection{$\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}$ as an indicator of broken mirror symmetry\label{tastwo-sec:Sbmsindicator}}

In the main text, we used the relation given by \cref{tastwo-eq:intensityequation} to show that the breaking of sixfold symmetry in the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel is consistent with the lowering of the surface point group from $C_{3v}$ to $C_3$ during the \gls{ic} to \gls{nc} phase transition.
In this section, we show how \cref{tastwo-eq:intensityequation} is derived.

Given any crystallographic point group, it is always possible to compute the form of the susceptibility tensor $\chi^S_{ijk}$.
In $C_3$, the susceptibility tensor is given by~\citep{boyd}
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility}
\chi^S_{ijk} = \begin{pmatrix}
\phantom{-}a & -b & \phantom{-}c\\
-b & -a & -d\\
\phantom{-}c & -d & \phantom{-}0\\
\hline
-b & -a & \phantom{-}d\\
-a & \phantom{-}b & \phantom{-}c\\
\phantom{-}d & \phantom{-}c & \phantom{-}0\\
\hline
\phantom{-}e & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0\\
\phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}e & \phantom{-}0\\
\phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}f
\end{pmatrix}_{ijk}
\end{equation}
for some $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ which are dependent on the material.
Here, the threefold axis is taken to be along the $z$ direction.
In the point group $C_{3v}$, the susceptibility tensor is constrained by symmetry so as to take a form which is the same as \cref{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility}, but with $b = d = 0$, i.e.

\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:Sc3vsusceptibility}
\chi^S_{ijk} = \begin{pmatrix}
\phantom{-}a & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}c\\
\phantom{-}0 & -a & \phantom{-}0\\
\phantom{-}c & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0\\
\hline
\phantom{-}0 & -a & \phantom{-}0\\
-a & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}c\\
\phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}c & \phantom{-}0\\
\hline
\phantom{-}e & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0\\
\phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}e & \phantom{-}0\\
\phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}f
\end{pmatrix}_{ijk}.
\end{equation}
Here, the mirror planes are taken to be the $xz$-plane and those related to it by rotation about the $z$-axis through $\pm \ang{120}$.

To compute the \gls{rashg} intensity in the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel, we consider a frame of reference in which the plane of incidence is held fixed and the sample is rotated about the optical axis.
This reference frame is equivalent to that of the experimental setup (where the sample is fixed and the plane of incidence rotates), but it is easier to visualize and formulate mathematically.
In this frame, the incoming $P$-polarized light at frequency $\omega$ is parallel to the vector $E_i(\omega) = (-\cos{\theta}, 0, \sin{\theta})^T_i$, and the outgoing $S$-polarized light which we wish to compute is parallel to the $y$-axis.
The \gls{rashg} intensity in this channel is therefore given by
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:Sipsequation}
I_{PS}^{2\omega}(\phi) \propto \left|P_y^{2\omega}(\phi)\right|^2 \propto \left|\bar{\chi}^S_{yjk}(-\phi)E_j(\omega)E_k(\omega)\right|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\chi}^S_{ijk}(\phi)$ is the susceptibility tensor corresponding to the sample when it has been rotated by an angle $\phi$.
The relative sign in the argument of $\bar{\chi}^S_{ijk}$ is due to the different reference frame used here compared to \cref{tastwo-fig:fig0b}, where $\phi$ is defined.

With the rotation matrix
\begin{equation}
R(\phi)_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\phi} & -\sin{\phi} & 0 \\
\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}_{ij},
\end{equation}
$\bar{\chi}^S_{ijk}(\phi)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:Srotatechi}
\bar{\chi}^S_{ijk}(\phi) = R(\phi)_{il}R(\phi)_{jm}R(\phi)_{kn}\chi^S_{lmn}.
\end{equation}
Substituting \cref{tastwo-eq:Srotatechi} into \cref{tastwo-eq:Sipsequation}, we then have
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:SintensityequationwithR}
I_{PS}^{2\omega}(\phi) \propto \left|R(-\phi)_{yl}R(-\phi)_{jm}R(-\phi)_{kn}\chi^S_{lmn}E_j(\omega)E_k(\omega)\right|^2.
\end{equation}

With \cref{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility} as $\chi^S_{ijk}$, we arrive at \cref{tastwo-eq:intensityequation} in the main text,
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:Sipsequationfinal}
I_\mathrm{PS}(2\omega) \propto (A_0 + A_1\cos{(3\phi)} + A_2\sin{(3\phi)})^2,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:sA_0equation}
A_0 = 2d\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:sA_1equation}
A_1 = -b\cos^{2}(\theta),
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:sA_2equation}
A_2 = a\cos^{2}(\theta).
\end{equation}
Since $b = d = 0$ in $C_{3v}$, these equations show that $A_0$ and $A_1$ are zero in the presence of mirror symmetry, as cited in the main text.
Furthermore, in $C_{3v}$, \cref{tastwo-eq:Sipsequationfinal} reduces to
\begin{equation}
I_\mathrm{PS}(2\omega) \propto A_2^2\sin^{2}(3\phi),
\end{equation}
which posesses sixfold rotational symmetry.

In the main text, we also remark that the breaking of sixfold rotational symmetry across the \gls{ic} to \gls{nc} phase transition can be quantified experimentally by performing a spectral (sine) decomposition of the measured intensity ($I_\mathrm{PS}^{2\omega}(\phi)$) and extracting the third Fourier coefficient, which we called $\mathscr{I}_\mathrm{PS}^{(3)}$.
Here, we define $\mathscr{I}_\mathrm{PS}^{(3)}$ explicitly and show that it is present in \tastwo only when mirror symmetry is broken.

The spectral decomposition for any given polarization channel ($\Gamma_\mathrm{in}$-$\Gamma_\mathrm{out}$) is defined formally by writing
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:fourierdecomposition}
I_{\Gamma_\mathrm{in}\Gamma_\mathrm{out}}^{2\omega}(\phi) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathscr{I}_{\Gamma_\mathrm{in}\Gamma_\mathrm{out}}^{(n)} \sin{\left[n\phi + \psi_{\Gamma_\mathrm{in}\Gamma_\mathrm{out}}^{(n)}\right]}.
\end{equation}
This equation defines $\mathscr{I}_{\Gamma_\mathrm{in}\Gamma_\mathrm{out}}^{(n)}$ and $\psi_{\Gamma_\mathrm{in}\Gamma_\mathrm{out}}^{(n)}$ as the amplitude and phase of the $n$-fold Fourier component of the corresponding SHG intensity. 

Using \cref{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility,tastwo-eq:SintensityequationwithR,tastwo-eq:fourierdecomposition}, we can then compute $\mathscr{I}^{(3)}_\mathrm{PS}$ and $\psi_{PS}^{(3)}$ in the low temperature phase as 
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:i3PS}
\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}(\chi^S_{ijk}) \propto 4\sqrt{C_1^2+C_2^2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\psi_{PS}^{(3)}(\chi^S_{ijk}) = \atantwo{\left(C_1,C_2\right)},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
C_1 = -b\cdot d\sin{\theta}\cos^3{\theta},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_2 = a\cdot d\sin{\theta}\cos^3{\theta},
\end{equation}
$\theta$ is the angle of incidence, and
\begin{equation}
\atantwo{(y, x)} \equiv \begin{cases}
\arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)} & x >  0 \\
\arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}+\pi & y>0,x <  0\\ 
\arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}-\pi & y<0,x <  0\\ 
+\frac{\pi}{2} & y>0, x=0\\
-\frac{\pi}{2} & y<0, x=0\\
\mathrm{undefined}& x = y = 0 \end{cases}.
\end{equation}
By comparing \cref{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility,tastwo-eq:Sc3vsusceptibility}, we find that
\begin{equation}
C_1 = C_2 = 0
\end{equation}
in the high temperature phase, so that $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}(\chi^S_{ijk}) = 0$. 

Note that \cref{tastwo-eq:i3PS} highlights an important aspect of our experiment, which is that $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}$ requires a nonzero angle of incidence to be observed.
This can be understood by noting that $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}$ is nonzero only when the tensor element $\chi^S_{yxz}$ is nonzero.
However, for such a term to be observable in the experiment, there needs to be an out-of-plane component to the incoming electric fields, which in turn requires a nonzero angle of incidence.
Moreover, in a system with three-fold symmetry like \tastwo, the aforementioned tensor element can only be nonzero in a system where mirror symmetry is absent.
To see that this is true, consider the term $P_y(2\omega)=\chi^S_{yxz}E_x(\omega)E_z(\omega)$.
Under an $x \rightarrow -x$ mirror operation, we require that $P_y \rightarrow P_y$, $E_x \rightarrow -E_x$, $E_z \rightarrow E_z$, and $\chi^S_{yxz} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^S_{yxz}$.
However, if this operation is a symmetry of the crystal then we have $\widetilde{\chi}^S_{yxz} = \chi^S_{yxz}$, so that $P_y = -P_y$.
This implies that $\chi^S_{yxz} = 0$.
Therefore both a nonzero angle of incidence and broken mirror symmetry are required for a nonzero $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(3)}$ in the geometry of our experiment.

\subsection{Physical importance of the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel}

In this section we explain physically why the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel is the most sensitive to mirror symmetry breaking in \tastwo.
Consider the experimental geometry depicted in \cref{tastwo-fig:mirrora}.
A $P$-polarized electric field $\bm{E}_\mathrm{in}$ is incident on a sample with vertical mirror symmetry about the $xz$ plane (indicated by the sides A and B of the sample being the same color). The geometry is such that the plane of incidence makes an angle $\phi$ with the reflection plane.
Let $\bm{P}_\perp(\phi)$ be the $S$-polarized component of the polarization resulting from second harmonic generation by the interaction of the sample with $\bm{E}_\mathrm{in}$.

\begin{figure}

\caption[Intuition for mirror symmetry breaking in SHG]{
\label{tastwo-fig:mirror}
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\caplabel, ref=\capref]
\item Geometry referenced in showing that the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ geometry is sensitive to the breaking of vertical mirror symmetry.

The arrow identifying the direction of $\bm{E}_\mathrm{in}$ is dashed to indicate that there is a component in the $z$-direction (out of the page).
The solid blue and dotted black lines represent the plane of incidence and the mirror symmetry plane, respectively, which are in the $z$-direction and make an angle $\phi$ with each other.
The two halves (A and B) of the sample are the same color to indicate that mirror symmetry is present in this sample.
\item Mirror image of \ref{tastwo-fig:mirrora}, showing that $\bm{P}_\perp$ flips sign (when measured in the frame of the plane of incidence) under mirror reflection.

(d) Mirror image of \ref{tastwo-fig:mirrorc}.
\end{enumerate*}
}
\end{figure}

Now consider applying the mirror operation both to $\bm{E}_\mathrm{in}$ and to the sample (\cref{tastwo-fig:mirrorb}).
Then the resulting $S$-polarized component of the polarization (in the frame of the plane of incidence) will be $-\bm{P}_\perp(\phi)$.
However, since the sides A and B in \cref{tastwo-fig:mirrorb} are the same, by symmetry the problem is equivalent to \cref{tastwo-fig:mirrora} but with $\phi$ replaced by $-\phi$.
Thus $\bm{P}_\perp(-\phi) = -\bm{P}_\perp(\phi)$, implying that $\bm{P}_\perp(0) = \bm{P}_\perp(\pi) = 0$.
This along with threefold rotational symmetry is sufficient to prove that the \gls{rashg} pattern from \gls{ic}-phase \tastwo in the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel is purely sixfold-symmetric.
However, in the case where mirror symmetry is broken (\cref{tastwo-fig:mirrorc,tastwo-fig:mirrord}) the above argument no longer holds and the constraint $\bm{P}_\perp(-\phi) = -\bm{P}_\perp(\phi)$ is relaxed.
Therefore in \tastwo, $\mathscr{I}_\mathrm{PS}^{(3)}$ is allowed in the \gls{nc} phase but not in the \gls{ic} phase.

\caption[Indicators of broken mirror symmetry in RA-SHG]{Indicators of broken mirror symmetry in mirror-symmetry-breaking transitions between noncentrosymmetric point groups. Values in the rightmost column (defined in \cref{tastwo-eq:fourierdecomposition}) are zero in the initial group and nonzero in the final group. In all cases, the analysis was done in a geometry such that the sample normal is parallel to the broken mirror plane (i.e. the mirror plane is vertical).}
\label{tastwo-tab:indicators}
\end{table}

In contrast to the $S$-polarized output ($\bm{P}_\perp(\phi)$), the $P$-polarized output ($\bm{P}_\parallel(\phi)$) does not change sign (as defined in the frame of the plane of incidence) under mirror reflection.
Therefore the constraint for $P$-polarized output is that $\bm{P}_\parallel(\phi) = \bm{P}_\parallel(-\phi)$.
Importantly, this constraint does not forbid fourier components like $\mathscr{I}_\mathrm{PP}^{(3)}$ and $\mathscr{I}_\mathrm{SP}^{(3)}$, even when mirror symmetry is present.

Finally, while the $S_\mathrm{in}$-$S_\mathrm{out}$ channel is subject to the constraint $\bm{P}_\perp(-\phi) = -\bm{P}_\perp(\phi)$, it can also be shown (see \cref{tastwo-sec:sstwofold}) that in the electric dipole regime, $S_\mathrm{in}$-$S_\mathrm{out}$ is twofold-symmetric regardless of the crystallographic point group.
Therefore the $P_\mathrm{in}$-$S_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel is especially sensitive to the breaking of vertical mirror plane symmetry in the geometry depicted in \cref{tastwo-fig:mirror}.

\subsection{Generalization to other mirror symmetry-breaking transitions}

While the argument above is effective in the case of a $C_{3v}$ to $C_3$ transition (as in \tastwo), the presence or absence of other symmetries in different point groups may call for symmetry arguments which differ from those above.
Therefore, to generalize this work we provide in \cref{tastwo-tab:indicators} a list of mirror-symmetry-breaking transitions between noncentrosymmetric point groups and identify corresponding terms (like $\mathscr{I}_\mathrm{PS}^{(3)}$ in \tastwo) which adopt nonzero values in the low-symmetry phase.
This table was generated using the same analysis as in \cref{tastwo-sec:Sbmsindicator} for \tastwo. 
Note that while \gls{rashg} is only nonzero in noncentrosymmetric point groups, it can still be used in centrosymmetric materials because crystal surfaces necessarily break inversion symmetry.

In most of the transitions in \cref{tastwo-tab:indicators}, $\mathscr{I}_{PS}^{(n)}$ can be used as an indicator of broken mirror symmetry for some $n$.
However, for others the \gls{rashg} pattern rotates rather than (or in addition to) changing symmetry, which is indicated by a change in the phase $\psi^{(n)}_{\Gamma_\mathrm{in}\Gamma_\mathrm{out}}$ of certain Fourier components.
Additionally, it should be observed that for a minority of the transitions in \cref{tastwo-tab:indicators}, \gls{rashg} is not sensitive to the breaking of mirror symmetry (e.g. in the transition from $T_d$ to $T$, two point groups for which the susceptibility tensor is equivalent).

\subsection{Probing the sense of planar chirality with RA-SHG}
\subsubsection{Complete RA-SHG data\label{tastwo-sec:complete_b}}
As in \cref{tastwo-sec:complete_a}, for completeness we reproduce in \cref{tastwo-fig:figS2} the \gls{rashg} data in the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ \gls{cdw} configurations, including the two polarization channels which were truncated from \cref{tastwo-fig:fig2} in the main text.
The poor fit in the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel again indicated to us that there was an additional bulk quadrupole contribution to the signal.

\subsubsection{Electron diffraction confirming the sample is single domain}
To confirm that \tastwo is single-domain in the \gls{nc} phase, we performed electron diffraction on a sample from the same batch as the one used for the \gls{rashg} measurements.
The absence of CDW sister peaks in \cref{tastwo-fig:diffraction} demonstrates that the sample is single-domain, in agreement with previous reports~\citep{zong_ultrafast_2018, wilson_charge-density_1975, bovet_pseudogapped_2004, shiba_phenomenological_1986}.
The thickness of the sample measured by electron diffraction was $\sim\qty{80}{nm}$, which is approximately equal to the penetration depth of \tastwo at $\qty{800}{nm}$~\citep{mann_probing_2016}.
We note that recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to inject mirror domains into an otherwise uniform sample of \tastwo using intense pulses of light~\citep{zong_ultrafast_2018}.
To control for this effect, we used an incident fluence of \qty{1.4}{mJ/cm^2} which is well below the threshold fluence \qty{5}{mJ/cm^2} reported in \citet{zong_ultrafast_2018}.

\end{enumerate*}
}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Fitting RA-SHG data in the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ configurations}
\label{tastwo-sec:mirrorflip}
To fit the data in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig2} of the main text, we performed the following procedure.
First, we used the six independent elements in the $C_{3}$ susceptibility tensor given by \cref{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility} as fitting parameters to fit the data on the $\alpha$ sample (\cref{tastwo-fig:figS2a}) to 
\begin{equation}
|P_i(\phi)|^2 \propto |R(-\phi)_{il}R(-\phi)_{jm}R(-\phi)_{kn}\chi_{lmn}^SE_j(\omega)E_k(\omega)|^2.
\end{equation}
The fit was constrained in such a way as to forbid large changes in the susceptibility elements that exist in both phases (i.e. $a$, $c$, $e$, and $f$).
This gave us a set of six numbers $\{\chi_{ijk}^\alpha\}$, from which we can form the tensor $\chi_{ijk}^\alpha$.
The cleaving operation can be represented by the operator $\mathcal{C} = A\Gamma(\gamma)R_x$, where $R_x$ is the operator which rotates the sample \ang{180} about the $x$-axis,
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:chiralityswitcher}
R_x = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
$\Gamma(\gamma)$ is the operator which rotates the sample about the $z$-axis by an arbitrary angle $\gamma$,
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(\gamma) = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\gamma} & -\sin{\gamma} & 0 \\
\sin{\gamma} & \cos{\gamma} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
and $A$ is a positive overall constant which represents minor, day-to-day fluctuations in experimental conditions.
If we were able to cleave the sample exactly along the high-symmetry axis, then $\gamma$ would be \ang{0} and $\Gamma(\gamma)$ would be identity.
Also note that the fact that the determinant of $\mathcal{C}$ in the $(x, y)$ subspace is $-1$ is equivalent to the statement that $\mathcal{C}$ switches the planar chirality of the sample.

To simulate the effect of cleaving the sample, we therefore applied $\mathcal{C}$ to $\chi_{ijk}^\alpha$ to form $\chi_{ijk}^\beta(\{\chi_{ijk}^\alpha\}, \gamma, A)$.
Formally, this amounts to computing
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:SapplyingC}
\chi_{ijk}^\beta(\{\chi_{ijk}^\alpha\}, \gamma, A) = \mathcal{C}_{il}(\gamma, A)\mathcal{C}_{jm}(\gamma, A)\mathcal{C}_{kn}(\gamma, A)\chi_{lmn}^\alpha.
\end{equation}

Now, $\chi_{ijk}^\beta(\{\chi_{ijk}^\alpha\}, \gamma, A)$ is a function of only two free parameters ($\gamma$ and $A$).
We find that with the proper choice of $\gamma$ and $A$, the signal computed with $\chi_{ijk}^\beta$ collapses onto the data in \cref{tastwo-fig:figS2b}.

By applying $R_x$ to the tensor given in \cref{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility}, one can see that the effect of cleaving the sample is to flip the sign of $b$ and $d$.
By examining \crefrange{tastwo-eq:Sipsequationfinal}{tastwo-eq:sA_2equation}, and noting that $A_1\approx 0$ within the resolution of our instrument, we see that this reproduces the change of the orientation of the \gls{rashg} pattern in the P$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel depicted in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig2} of the main text.

\subsection{Bulk broken mirror symmetry in \tastwo} \label{tastwo-sec:Squadrupole}

\subsubsection{Complete RA-SHG data at $T=295K$}

As in \cref{tastwo-sec:complete_b}, for completeness we reproduce in \cref{tastwo-fig:295K} the \gls{rashg} data at $T=295K$ (\gls{nc} phase) which is used in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3} to argue that there is a nonzero bulk electric quadrupole component to the measured signal.
Furthermore, we reproduce in \cref{tastwo-fig:356K} the \gls{rashg} data at $T=356K$ (\gls{ic} phase) to show that we can fit all four polarization combinations using the surface point group $C_{3v}$ as well as a bulk point group $S_6$, which is the highest-symmetry subgroup of the undistorted point group which breaks mirror symmetry (see below).
The S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel of \cref{tastwo-fig:356K} is shown in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3} of the main text.

\subsubsection{Symmetry analysis of RA-SHG data} \label{tastwo-sec:sstwofold}

In the last section of the main text, we used the relation given by \cref{tastwo-eq:qintensityequation} to argue that the breaking of sixfold symmetry in the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ polarization channel indicates that bulk mirror symmetry is broken in the \gls{ic} phase of \tastwo.
Here we derive \cref{tastwo-eq:qintensityequation} as we did \cref{tastwo-eq:intensityequation} in \cref{tastwo-sec:Sbmsindicator}.

As mentioned in the main text, the effective polarization for bulk electric quadrupole SHG is given by~\citep{kumar_magnetic_2017, shen}
\begin{equation}
\nabla_j Q_{ij} = 2i\chi_{ijkl}^Qk_j E_k E_l,
\end{equation}
so that the total intensity in the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel (including surface electric dipole) is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:SQintensity}
I_{SS}^{2\omega}(\phi) \propto \left|\left(\bar{\chi}^S_{yjk}(-\phi)+2i \bar{\chi}_{ypjk}^Q(-\phi)k_p\right)E_j(\omega)E_k(\omega)\right|^2,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{\chi}^S_{ijk}(\phi) = R(\phi)_{il}R(\phi)_{jm}R(\phi)_{kn}\chi^S_{lmn},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\chi}^Q_{ipjk}(\phi) = R(\phi)_{il}R(\phi)_{pq}R(\phi)_{jm}R(\phi)_{kn}\chi_{lqmn}^Q,
\end{equation}
and $E_i(\omega) = (0, 1, 0)^T_i$.

In the \gls{nc} phase of \tastwo, the appropriate assignment for the surface and bulk point groups is given by diffraction measurements~\citep{spijkerman_x-ray_1997} to be $C_3$ and $S_6$, respectively.
Therefore for $\chi^S_{ijk}$ we use the tensor defined by \cref{tastwo-eq:Sc3susceptibility}, and for $\chi^Q_{ijkl}$ we use the tensor given in \citet{boyd} for the point group $S_6$ (which for the sake of brevity we do not reproduce here).
With these tensors, we then have
\begin{equation}
\label{tastwo-eq:Sequationwithbs}
I_\mathrm{SS}(2\omega) \propto (B_0+B_1\cos{(3\phi)}+B_2\sin{(3\phi)})^2,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
B_0 = \chi^Q_{xyxx}\sin{\theta},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
B_1 = \chi^S_{yyy} -\chi^Q_{xzxy}\cos{\theta},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
B_2 = -\chi^S_{xxx}+\chi^Q_{xzyy}\cos{\theta}.
\end{equation}

Importantly, if bulk mirror symmetry were restored in the \gls{ic} phase we would have $\chi^Q_{xyxx} = \chi^Q_{xzxy} = 0$, and therefore $B_0=0$. 
This can be checked by inspecting the quadrupole susceptibility tensor for the undistorted bulk point group $D_{3d}$ (which preserves vertical mirror symmetry) defined in \citet{boyd}.

Electron diffraction data from a sample of \tastwo in the \gls{nc} phase of the same batch as the one used in \gls{rashg} measurements.
Surrounding each Bragg reflection can be seen six CDW peaks, which are rotated about $\tau=\ang{13}$ from the high-symmetry axes.
The sign of the rotation angle $\tau$ indicates whether the CDW configuration is $\alpha$ or $\beta$.
The lack of additional CDW peaks $\ang{-13}$ from the high-symmetry axes indicates that the sample is single-domain.

Since $B_0=0$ if the pattern possesses sixfold rotational symmetry (as can be seen by taking $\phi\to\phi+\ang{60}$), we have that the breaking of sixfold rotational symmetry in the \gls{rashg} pattern (\cref{tastwo-fig:fig3c} of the main text) implies $B\neq 0$.
This implies that $\chi^Q_{xyxx} \neq 0$, and therefore mirror symmetry is broken in the bulk.

There are two additional important remarks which can be made about \cref{tastwo-eq:Sequationwithbs}.
For one, it should be noted that the $\theta$ dependence observed in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a,tastwo-fig:fig3b} is consistent with \cref{tastwo-eq:Sequationwithbs}, since $B_0=0$ for $\theta=0$.
Additionally, we see that in the absence of the quadrupole component (i.e. for purely electric dipole SHG), $B_0 = 0$ and the pattern should have sixfold rotational symmetry.
Since the data in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a,tastwo-fig:fig3c} clearly break this symmetry, this supports our claim that their is an extra contribution to the \gls{rashg} beyond the surface electric dipole contribution.

A more intuitive way to understand why the threefold spectral component in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a,tastwo-fig:fig3} is not allowed by pure electric dipole SHG is to note that, for purely electric dipole SHG, the rotational anisotropy always has at least twofold symmetry in the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel.
To see that this is true, consider the effect of taking $\phi\rightarrow\phi+\pi$ in an $S$-polarized input geometry.
In the frame where the sample is stationary, this simply changes the sign of the input field. 
Since the polarization is proportional to the square of the input field ($P_i(2\omega) = \chi_{ijk}E_j E_k$), then it will be symmetric under $\phi\rightarrow\phi+\pi$, as will be its projection out of the plane of incidence (note, however, that because the component of $\bm{P}(2\omega)$ parallel to the direction of propogation is not visible in the experiment, the same cannot be said for the $P$-polarized output).
Therefore, if the measured \gls{rashg} in the S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$ channel lacks twofold symmetry, then there is a contribution to the rotational anisotropy which exists beyond the electric dipole.

For the sake of completeness, we also note here two alternative explanations for the breaking of sixfold rotational symmetry depicted in \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3c} which do not appeal to an additional quadrupole contribution.
Firstly, it is possible that the surface of the sample was rough or nonuniform in such a way as to modulate the observed SHG intensity as a function of $\phi$.
In principle, this could result in a nonzero $B_0$.
To account for this artifact, we measured SHG on \tastwo in multiple locations and on multiple different samples, and found that the results in this work were consistent across all measurements.
Furthermore, with SHG measurements there is always the possibility of an additional contribution arising from the presence of adsorbates on the sample surface\citep{berkovic_interference_1988}.
While such a contribution may be present in our experiment, we note that this too is an unlikely explanation for the nonzero $B_0$ because of the wavevector dependence of \cref{tastwo-fig:fig3a,tastwo-fig:fig3b}.
This is because the dominant contribution from adsorbates is generally of the electric dipole type and therefore should not depend on $\bm{k}$ in S$_\mathrm{in}$-S$_\mathrm{out}$.

\subsection{Methods}

\gls{rashg} data was taken with the \qty{800}{nm} pulsed output of a regeneratively amplified Ti:Sapphire laser operating at \qty{5}{kHz}.
The beam was scattered by a transmissive phase grating into multiple diffraction orders, and the +1-order component was steered through a polarizer and focused onto the sample with a fluence of \qty{1.4}{mJ/cm^2} and a spot diameter of $\sim$150$\mu$m at a \ang{10} angle with respect to the $(001)$ sample normal.
This experimental geometry is similar to that described in \citet{harter_high-speed_2015} and \citet{torchinsky_low_2014}.
The reflected light at \qty{400}{nm} was directed through an analyzer and into a photomultiplier tube, where the intensity was measured with a lock-in amplifier synchronized to the \qty{5}{kHz} pulsed output of the laser with a \qty{1}{ms} time constant.
We rotated the phase grating at $\sim\qty{5}{Hz}$ and recorded the signal as a function of time with an oscilloscope triggered on an optical rotary encoder marking \ang{360} rotations.
Each polarization combination required averaging 5000 rotations.
Using the aforementioned encoder, we expressed the corresponding time trace in terms of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ (\cref{tastwo-fig:fig0b}) to obtain the full rotational anisotropy.

The thickness of the samples used in the \gls{rashg} experiments was $\sim\qty{50}{\mu m}$.
