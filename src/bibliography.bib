	abstract = {We study the interplay between electronic correlations and hybridization in the low-energy electronic structure of CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$, a candidate hybridization-gap semiconductor. Utilizing state-of-the-art advanced density functionals we find both the antiferromagnetic N{\textbackslash}'eel order and band gap in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. We further find that, under hydrostatic pressure, the band gap is mainly governed by magnetic correlations, whereas hybridization has a greater impact on states at higher band energies. This result suggests that CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$ is more closely related to the high-temperature superconducting cuprates and iron pnictides than the heavy fermion class of materials. Finally, we also find the antiferromagnetic CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$ to be topologically trivial for all pressures studied.},

	abstract = {In three different antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials we show that the magnetization dynamics of AFM compounds differs noticeably from that of ferromagnetic compounds. Optical second harmonic generation and linear reﬂection were used to monitor with a temporal resolution of {\textless}1 ps the evolution of the AFM order parameter subsequent to an intense optical excitation. Comparison of the dynamical properties of the model antiferromagnet Cr2O3 with model ferro- and ferrimagnets reveals that spin–lattice relaxation as the temporally limiting thermalization process of the magnetic subsystem is more complex and inherently faster than in compounds displaying a spontaneous magnetization. The exchange-bias compound NiO exhibits an ultrafast photoinduced AFM phase transition in the course of which the AFM order parameter is switched by 90◦. Properly timed sequences of pump pulses can repeatedly reorient the AFM order parameter within 10 ps, thus demonstrating ultrafast AFM switching. In the colossal-magnetoresistance compound Pr1−xCaxMnO3 optical pumping triggers a transition from an insulating AFM to a conducting metallic state within 230 fs.},

In this paper we present theoretical study of the nonlinear conductivity in odd-parity magnetic multipole ordered systems whose \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{PT\}\$-symmetry is essentially distinct from the previously studied acentric systems. Combining microscopic formulation and symmetry analysis, we classify the nonlinear responses in the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{PT\}\$-symmetric systems as well as \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$-symmetric (non-magnetic) systems, and uncover nonlinear conductivity unique to the odd-parity magnetic multipole systems. A giant nonlinear Hall effect, nematicity-assisted dichroism and magnetically-induced Berry curvature dipole effect are proposed and demonstrated in a model for Mn-based magnets.},

              One of the most intriguing features of some high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the interplay between one-dimensional “striped” spin order and charge order, and superconductivity.

              is widely considered to be a topological Weyl semimetal, with evidence for momentum-space monopoles of Berry curvature from transport and spectroscopic probes. As the bandstructure is highly sensitive to the magnetic order, attention has focused on anomalies in magnetization, susceptibility and transport measurements that are seen well below the Curie temperature, leading to speculation that a “hidden” phase coexists with ferromagnetism. Here we report spatially-resolved measurements by Kerr effect microscopy that identify this phase. We find that the anomalies coincide with a deep minimum in domain wall (DW) mobility, indicating a crossover between two regimes of DW propagation. We demonstrate that this crossover is a manifestation of a 2D phase transition that occurs within the DW, in which the magnetization texture changes from continuous rotation to unidirectional variation. We propose that the existence of this 2D transition deep within the ferromagnetic state of the bulk is a consequence of a giant quality factor for magnetocrystalline anisotropy unique to this compound. This work broadens the horizon of the conventional binary classification of DWs into Bloch and Néel walls, and suggests new strategies for manipulation of domain walls and their role in electron and spin transport.},

              Efficient manipulation of antiferromagnetic (AF) domains and domain walls has opened up new avenues of research towards ultrafast, high-density spintronic devices. AF domain structures are known to be sensitive to magnetoelastic effects, but the microscopic interplay of crystalline defects, strain and magnetic ordering remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal, using photoemission electron microscopy combined with scanning X-ray diffraction imaging and micromagnetic simulations, that the AF domain structure in CuMnAs thin films is dominated by nanoscale structural twin defects. We demonstrate that microtwin defects, which develop across the entire thickness of the film and terminate on the surface as characteristic lines, determine the location and orientation of 180

This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions—spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital—are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.},

              Magneto-optical memory storage media, such as hard drives, use magnetic fields to change the magnetization of memory bits, but the process is slow. Light can often reveal information about the magnetization state of a sample, such as its field direction. Lambert
              et al.
              show that under the right circumstances, light can also switch the magnetization state of a thin ferromagnetic film. Using light pulses instead of magnetic fields led to ultrafast data memory and data storage.

            The all-optical control of magnetization in thin ferromagnetic films is demonstrated.
          , 
            The interplay of light and magnetism allowed light to be used as a probe of magnetic materials. Now the focus has shifted to use polarized light to alter or manipulate magnetism. Here, we demonstrate optical control of ferromagnetic materials ranging from magnetic thin films to multilayers and even granular films being explored for ultra-high-density magnetic recording. Our finding shows that optical control of magnetic materials is a much more general phenomenon than previously assumed and may have a major impact on data memory and storage industries through the integration of optical control of ferromagnetic bits.},

	title = {Pressure effect on multiferroic {CuBr2}},
	abstract = {The quasi-1D spin chain compound CuBr2 has been found to be multiferroic below TN ({\textasciitilde}73.5K) under ambient pressure, in which the spontaneous electric polarization is induced by emerging spin spiral ordering propagating along b-axis. Herein we studied the hydrostatic pressure effect on the magnetic, dielectric and structural properties of CuBr2. The multiferroic transition temperature is greatly enhanced under hydrostatic pressure. From ambient to about 1 GPa (the limit of our homemade apparatus), TN increases unprecedentedly by more than 20K, and no sign of saturation is observed in our experiments. Meanwhile the corresponding dielectric loss keeps rather low ({\textless}{\textless}0.1). Further synchrotron-based high pressure X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that there is no pressure-induced structural phase transition in CuBr2 up to 10.2 GPa. Upon increasing pressure, the b-axis (along the spin chain) just changes slowly while transverse a- and c- axis parameters shrink much more greatly. Pressure greatly reduces the separation between spin chains and enhance the inter-chain coupling interactions in CuBr2, which results in the giant increase of multiferroic critical temperate. Our finding suggests a new effective way to improve the known multiferroic systems towards practical high temperature multiferroicity.},

High quality of the sample is demonstrated by the sharp magnetic and magnetic-driven ferroelectric transition at TN = TC ≈ 74 K. The zero-ﬁeld 79Br and 81Br NMR are resolved below TN. The spin-lattice relaxation rates reveal charge ﬂuctuations when cooled below 60 K. Evidences of an increase of NMR linewidth, a reduction of dielectric constant, and an increase of magnetic susceptibility are also seen at low temperatures. These data suggest an emergent instability which competes with the spiral magnetic ordering and the ferroelectricity. Candidate mechanisms are discussed based on the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the magnetic system.},

	abstract = {Periodic and cluster density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, including DFT+U and hybrid functionals, are applied to study magnetostructural correlations in spin-1/2 frustrated chain compounds CuX2: CuCl2, CuBr2, and a fictitious chain structure of CuF2. The nearest-neighbor and second-neighbor exchange integrals, J1 and J2, are evaluated as a function of the Cu-X-Cu bridging angle, theta, in the physically relevant range 80-110deg. In the ionic CuF2, J1 is ferromagnetic for theta smaller 100deg. For larger angles, the antiferromagnetic superexchange contribution becomes dominant, in accord with the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules. However, both CuCl2 and CuBr2 feature ferromagnetic J1 in the whole angular range studied. This surprising behavior is ascribed to the increased covalency in the Cl and Br compounds, which amplifies the contribution from Hund's exchange on the ligand atoms and renders J1 ferromagnetic. At the same time, the larger spatial extent of X orbitals enhances the antiferromagnetic J2, which is realized via the long-range Cu-X-X-Cu paths. Both, periodic and cluster approaches supply a consistent description of the magnetic behavior which is in good agreement with the experimental data for CuCl2 and CuBr2. Thus, owing to their simplicity, cluster calculations have excellent potential to study magnetic correlations in more involved spin lattices and facilitate application of quantum-chemical methods.},

	abstract = {Neutron diffraction studies of many magnetoelectrics and corresponding symmetry analysis indi cate that the description of their magnetic structures requires of invoking two or more order parameters, so that the temperature proximity of their “condensation” has to be postulated when constructing a consistent thermodynamic theory. In this work, MnWO4, CuO, and CuCl2 magnetoelectrics are analyzed from the standpoint of symmetry of the exchange Hamiltonian. The magnetically ordering states observed in them are shown to be induced by one irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the exchange Hamiltonian. This fact provides the proximity of corresponding instabilities in the thermodynamic path and some features of magnetoelectrics.},

	abstract = {Multiferroics, compounds with both magnetic and ferroelectric orders, are believed to be a key material system to achieve cross-control between magnetism and electricity in a solid with minute energy dissipation. Such a colossal magnetoelectric (ME) effect has been an issue of keen interest for a long time in condensed matter physics as well as a most desired function in the emerging spin-related electronics. Here we begin with the basic mechanisms to realize multiferroicity or spin-driven ferroelectricity in magnetic materials, which have recently been clariﬁed and proved both theoretically and experimentally. According to the proposed mechanisms, many families of multiferroics have been explored, found (re-discovered), and newly developed, realizing a variety of colossal ME controls. We overview versatile multiferroics from the viewpoints of their multiferroicity mechanisms and their fundamental ME characteristics on the basis of the recent advances in exploratory materials. One of the new directions in multiferroic science is the dynamical ME effect, namely the dynamical and/or fast cross-control between electric and magnetic dipoles in a solid. We argue here that the dynamics of multiferroic domain walls signiﬁcantly contributes to the ampliﬁcation of ME response, which has been revealed through the dielectric spectroscopy. Another related issue is the electric-dipole-active magnetic resonance, called electromagnons. The electromagnons can provide a new stage of ME optics via resonant coupling with the external electromagnetic wave (light). Finally, we give concluding remarks on multiferroics physics in the light of a broader perspective from the emergent electromagnetism in a solid as well as from the possible application toward future dissipationless electronics.},

We find that the spin orientation observed for these spin-1/2 ions is not caused by their anisotropic spin exchange interactions, nor by their magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, but by the spin-orbit coupling associated with their crystal-field split d-states. Our study also predicts in-plane anisotropy for the Cu2+ ions of Bi2CuO4 and Li2CuO2.

Although this technique has been successfully used to study the lattice and magnetic structures of systems such as semiconductor surfaces, multiferroic crystals, magnetic thin films, and multilayers, challenging technical requirements have prevented its application to the plethora of complex electronic phases found in strongly correlated electron systems. These requirements include an ability to probe small bulk single crystals at the μm length scale, a need for sensitivity to the entire nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor, oblique light incidence reflection geometry, and incident light frequency tunability among others. These measurements are further complicated by the need for extreme sample environments such as ultra low temperatures, high magnetic fields, or high pressures. In this review we present a novel experimental construction using a rotating light scattering plane that meets all the aforementioned requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by making symmetry measurements on a μm scale facet of a small bulk single crystal of Sr2IrO4 using optical second and third harmonic generation.},

The polarization increases whereas the dielectric constant decreases with increasing ℎ due to strong magnetoelectric coupling. In a CuBr2 nanoparticle appears a weak ferromagnetism due to the uncompensated spins on the surface. The magnetization increases with decreasing nanoparticle size. The Neel temperature rises strongly applying by ion doping a compressive strain and decreases by a tensile strain.},

The non-zero components of the SHG susceptibility in the ordered phase are derived from the symmetries of the susceptibility tensor in the high-temperature phase and the symmetry of the order parameter. In this derivation, the dependence of the SHG susceptibility on the order parameter follows naturally, and therefore its nonreciprocal optical properties. We examine this phenomenology for the magnetoelectric compound Cr2O3 as well as for the ferroelectromagnet YMnO3.},

	abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke’s power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difﬁcult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difﬁcult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efﬁcient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.},

The study of multiferroics dates back to the 1950s, but in recent years, key discoveries in theory, synthesis and characterization techniques have led to a new surge of interest in these materials. Different mechanisms, such as lone-pair, geometric, charge-ordering and spin-driven effects, can support multiferroicity. The general focus of the field is now shifting into neighbouring research areas, as we discuss in this Review. Multiferroic thin-film heterostructures, device architectures, and domain and interface effects are explored. The violation of spatial and inversion symmetry in multiferroic materials is a key feature because it determines their properties. Other aspects, such as the non-equilibrium dynamics of multiferroics, are underrated and should be included in the topics that will define the future of the field.},

	abstract = {The order parameter and its variations in space and time in many different states in condensed matter physics at low temperatures are described by the complex function C(r, t). These states include superfluids, superconductors, and a subclass of antiferromagnets and charge density waves. The collective fluctuations in the ordered state may then be categorized as oscillations of phase and amplitude of C(r, t). The phase oscillations are the Goldstone modes of the broken continuous symmetry. The amplitude modes, even at long wavelengths, are well defined and are decoupled from the phase oscillations only near particle-hole symmetry, where the equations of motion have an effective Lorentz symmetry, as in particle physics and if there are no significant avenues for decay into other excitations. They bear close correspondence with the so-called Higgs modes in particle physics, whose prediction and discovery are very important for the standard model of particle physics. In this review, we discuss the theory and the possible observation of the amplitude or Higgs modes in condensed matter physics—in superconductors, cold atoms in periodic lattices, and uniaxial antiferromagnets. We discuss the necessity for at least approximate particle-hole symmetry as well as the special conditions required to couple to such modes because, being scalars, they do not couple linearly to the usual condensed matter probes.},

	abstract = {Since a symmetric spin-dependent electric polarization makes quantum spin systems couple to an electric ﬁeld, it is one of a possible origin of electromagnon excitations in noncollinear (spiral) magnetically ordered states. In collinear ordered states, however, it is believed that the electromagnon excitation is diﬃcult to realize. In the present study, we focus on the symmetric spin-dependent electric polarization and study the electromagnon excitation in both collinear and noncollinear states. In one-magnon excitation process, it is found that the symmetric spin-dependent polarization couples to a longitudinal ﬂuctuation of the ordered moment and that the electromagnon measurements probe the longitudinal (Higgs) mode selectively. In noncollinear states, we report that both Higgs and Nambu-Goldstone (transverse) modes are observable.},

The Standard Model spinparity J C P = 0++ hypothesis is compared with alternative hypotheses for both spin and CP. The case where the observed resonance is a mixture of the Standard-Model-like Higgs boson and CP-even (J C P = 0++) or CP-odd (J C P = 0+−) Higgs boson in scenarios beyond the Standard Model is also studied. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model prediction and limits are placed on alternative spin and CP hypotheses, including CP mixing in different scenarios.},

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

	abstract = {The 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 superstructure of 1T––TaSe2 at room temperature has been studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The basic structure has symmetry P 3m1 with a0 ¼ 3.4733  A and c0 ¼ 6.2715  A. The superstructure has a pseudo hexagonal lattice, but it is triclinic with a 169-fold, 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 Â 13c0 hexagonal supercell with 13 centering vectors. Structure refinements have been performed using space group P 1 and the primitive unit cell with a basal plane 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 supercell, and with C ¼ 2a0 þ c0. Refinements converged to RF ¼ 0.086 for 2327 observed reflections. Hexagram shaped clusters of 13 Ta atoms are the principle feature of this 13-fold superstructure, in accordance with the study of Brouwer and Jellinek (Physica B 99 (1980) 51). In the present refinement, significant deviations are found from local 6/m symmetry as it was assumed by Brouwer and Jellinek. The relative phase of the superstructure on neighbouring layers represents the most favourable packing of the buckled planes of Se atoms, and elastic coupling between Se atoms of consecutive layers is identified as the driving force for the observed inter-layer shift vector 2a0. The small deviations from trigonal symmetry of the clusters are responsible for the observation of an ordered superstructure, as it is opposed to a stacking of layers according a random selection of shift vectors (2a0, 2a0 þ b0, and Àa0 À 3b0) that are equivalent by the trigonal symmetry of the basic structure.},

The averaged dielectric function agrees with the available experimental data except that the calculated peak heights are underestimated and shifted to higher energies by 1–2 eV.},

	abstract = {Phase transitions in 2D materials can lead to massive changes in electronic properties that enable novel electronic devices. Tantalum disulﬁde (TaS2), speciﬁcally the “1T” phase (1T-TaS2), exhibits a phase transition based on the formation of commensurate charge density waves (CCDW) at 180 K. In this work, we investigate the impact of substrate choice on the phase transitions in ultrathin 1T-TaS2. Doping and charge transfer from the substrate has little impact on CDW phase transitions. On the contrary, we demonstrated that substrate surface roughness is a primary extrinsic factor in CCDW transition temperature and hysteresis, where higher roughness leads to smaller transition hysteresis. Such roughness can be simulated via surface texturing of SiO2/Si substrates, which controllably and reproducibly induces periodic strain in the 1TTaS2 and thereby enables the potential for engineering CDW phase transitions.},

	abstract = {The band structure, density of states and anisotropic frequency-dependent optical properties have been calculated for the 1 T and 2 H phases of TaS2 and TaSe2 using the full-potential linear augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) method. In the 1 T and 2 H phases, when S is replaced by Se, the unoccupied Ta-5d and chalcogen-p bands move closer to the Fermi energy EF and the bandwidth of the chalcogen-s group decreases. Compared to the 1 T phase, in the 2 H phase the occupied/unoccupied bands move towards higher/lower energies with respect to EF. In the 1 T phase, when S is replaced by Se, the peak positions in the imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function  2ðoÞ move towards lower energies by 0.5 eV. The single peak at 6 eV in  2ðoÞ of the 1 T phase is split into two peaks in the 2 H phase. We make a detailed comparison of the frequency-dependent reﬂectivity and absorption coefﬁcient with the available experimental data. The linear mufﬁn tin orbital method within the atomic sphere approximation (LMTOASA) shows poor agreement with the experimental data while our FPLAPW results give excellent agreement with the experimental data suggesting that a better representation of the potential is essential for calculating optical properties accurately.},

	abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate abrupt, reversible switching of resistance in 1T-TaS2 using dc and pulsed sources, corresponding to an insulator-metal transition between the insulating Mott and equilibrium metallic states. This transition occurs at a constant critical resistivity of 7 mohm-cm regardless of temperature or bias conditions and the transition time is signiﬁcantly smaller than abrupt transitions by avalanche breakdown in other small gap Mott insulating materials. Furthermore, this critical resistivity corresponds to a carrier density of 4.5 × 1019 cm-3, which compares well with the critical carrier density for the commensurate to nearly commensurate charge density wave transition. These results suggest that the transition is facilitated by a carrier driven collapse of the Mott gap in 1T-TaS2, which results in fast (3 ns) switching.},

The basic models behind charge-density-wave formation in low-dimensional solids are recapitulated, the experimental and theoretical results for the three selected compounds are reviewed, and their band structures and spectral weight distributions in the commensurate charge-density-wave phases are calculated using an empirical tight-binding model. It is explored whether the origin of charge-density waves in the layered transition-metal dichalcogenides can be understood in a uniﬁed way on the basis of a few measured and calculated parameters characterizing the interacting electron–lattice system. It is found that the predictions of the standard mean-ﬁeld model agree only semi-quantitatively with the experimental data and that there is not one generally dominant factor driving charge-density-wave formation in this family of layer compounds. The need for further experimental and theoretical scrutiny is emphasized.},

These waves are incommensurate with the matrix in lT, and lT,, but form a commensurate superlattice in lT,. Within lT,, the temperature dependence of the wave vector is correlated with a change in the cross-section of the Fermi surface, while the diffuse scattering which accompanies the discrete reflexions in lT, is discussed as a n image of this surface in the phonon spectrum.

This study revealed that noise in 1T-TaS2 has two pronounced maxima at the bias voltages, which correspond to the onset of CDW sliding and the NC-to-IC phase transition. We observed unusual Lorentzian features and exceptionally strong noise dependence on electric bias and temperature, leading to the conclusion that electronic noise in 2D CDW systems has a unique physical origin diﬀerent from known fundamental noise types. We argue that noise spectroscopy can serve as a useful tool for understanding electronic transport phenomena in 2D CDW materials characterized by coexistence of diﬀerent phases and strong pinning.},

The primary aim here is to present the diffraction evidence from electron, X-ray, and neutron observations for the adoption of a charge density wave ground state coupled to a periodic lattice distortion and to show how this ground state may be perturbed by substitutional doping and intercalation. The electronic consequences of these effects are then briefly reviewed.},

	abstract = {Using temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy we address the question of how the transition from bulk to few atomic layers aﬀects the charge density wave (CDW) phases in 1T-TaS2. We ﬁnd that for crystals with thickness larger than ≈ 10nm the transition temperatures between the diﬀerent phases as well as the hysteresis that occurs in the thermal cycle correspond to the ones expected for a bulk sample. However, when the crystals become thinner than ≈ 10nm, the commensurate CDW phase is suppressed down to the experimentally accessible temperatures. In addition, the nearly commensurate CDW phase is diminished below ≈ 4nm. These ﬁndings suggest that the interlayer coupling plays a signiﬁcant role in determining the properties of CDW systems consisting of a few unit cells in the vertical direction.},

Here, using large-area scanning tunneling microscopy we reveal an intricate chiral vortex structure and complex tiling of charged electron domains in the metastable metallic state in 1T-TaS2 created by a non-equilibrium topological transition initiated by a single femtosecond optical pulse. A Moir´e analysis shows that the interference of non-equilibrium nested Fermi surface (FS) electrons leads to the creation of charge vortices D on a length scale of ∼70 nm. On a much smaller scale of ∼ 5 nm, domain conﬁgurational patterns appear, which show bound vortex-antivortex pairs, discommensurations, domain wall (DW) crossings and DW kinks, consistent with a rapidly quenched Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Revealing the detailed mechanism for the transition leads the way to design of long-range charge-ordered metastable states with intricate emergent properties under controlled non-equilibrium conditions.},

    abstract = {Domain walls (DWs) are singularities in an ordered medium that often host exotic phenomena such as charge ordering, insulator-metal transition, or superconductivity. The ability to locally write and erase DWs is highly desirable, as it allows one to design material functionality by patterning DWs in specific configurations. We demonstrate such capability at room temperature in a charge density wave (CDW), a macroscopic condensate of electrons and phonons, in ultrathin 1T-TaS2. A single femtosecond light pulse is shown to locally inject or remove mirror DWs in the CDW condensate, with probabilities tunable by pulse energy and temperature. Using time-resolved electron diffraction, we are able to simultaneously track anti-synchronized CDW amplitude oscillations from both the lattice and the condensate, where photoinjected DWs lead to a red-shifted frequency. Our demonstration of reversible DW manipulation may pave new ways for engineering correlated material systems with light.},

The method directly measures the nth harmonics of the scanning frequency corresponding to SHG signal components of Cn symmetry that appear in a Fourier series expansion of a general RA-SHG signal. GaAs was used as a test sample allowing comparison of point-by-point averaging with the lock-in based method. When divided by the C\&\#x0221E; signal component, the lock-in detected data allowed for both self-referenced determination of ratios of Cn components of up to 1 part in 104 and significantly more sensitive measurement of the relative amount of different Cn components when compared with conventional methods.},

We show that in single-beam setups the main contribution is found for the silicon (111) surface, and only a minor contribution for the (001) and (011) facets. The dipole contribution obtained from our model is compared to literature values for SiC, AlAs and GaAs to demonstrate the viability of the method.},

It has emerged that, in terms of their mathematical description, there are surprisingly close parallels between them. This interplay has been the subject of a very successful European Science Foundation (ESF) programme entitled COSLAB (‘Cosmology in the Laboratory’) that ran from 2001 to 2006, itself built on an earlier ESF network called TOPDEF (‘Topological Defects: Non-equilibrium Field Theory in Particle Physics, Condensed Matter and Cosmology’). The articles presented in this issue of
              Philosophical Transactions A
              are based on talks given at the Royal Society Discussion Meeting ‘Cosmology meets condensed matter’, held on 28 and 29 January 2008. Many of the speakers had participated earlier in the COSLAB programme, but the strength of the field is illustrated by the presence also of quite a few new participants.},

Despite extensive work, the essential physics of many of these systems is not understood and there is very little ability to make predictions in this class of materials. In this manuscript we share our personal views on the major open problems in the field of correlated electron systems. We discuss some possible routes to make progress in this rich and fascinating field. This manuscript is the result of the vigorous discussions and deliberations that took place at Johns Hopkins University during a three-day workshop January 27, 28, and 29, 2020 that brought together six senior scientists and 46 more junior scientists. Our hope, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies.},

The non-zero components of the SHG susceptibility in the ordered phase are derived from the symmetries of the susceptibility tensor in the high-temperature phase and the symmetry of the order parameter. In this derivation, the dependence of the SHG susceptibility on the order parameter follows naturally, and therefore its nonreciprocal optical properties. We examine this phenomenology for the magnetoelectric compound Cr2O3 as well as for the ferroelectromagnet YMnO3.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optical generation from a crystalline material can reveal the symmetries of both its lattice structure and underlying ordered electronic phases and can therefore be exploited as a complementary technique to diffraction based scattering probes. Although this technique has been successfully used to study the lattice and magnetic structures of systems such as semiconductor surfaces, multiferroic crystals, magnetic thin films, and multilayers, challenging technical requirements have prevented its application to the plethora of complex electronic phases found in strongly correlated electron systems. These requirements include an ability to probe small bulk single crystals at the μm length scale, a need for sensitivity to the entire nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor, oblique light incidence reflection geometry, and incident light frequency tunability among others. These measurements are further complicated by the need for extreme sample environments such as ultra low temperatures, high magnetic fields, or high pressures. In this review we present a novel experimental construction using a rotating light scattering plane that meets all the aforementioned requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by making symmetry measurements on a μm scale facet of a small bulk single crystal of Sr2IrO4 using optical second and third harmonic generation.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input ﬁles) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) deﬁning core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from ﬁrst principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We ﬁnd that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {This study examines wear phenomenon occurring in high-current density self-mated metal copper sliding contacts in humid carbon dioxide environments. A custom tribometer built to test macroscopic (lightly loaded) brush and slip-ring sliding electrical contacts at relatively high speed and current density is described in the text. Data is presented as further evidence that at some elevated current density (between 120 and 180 A/cm2) there is a transition in the wear mechanism as the brush wear rates, friction coefﬁcients, and contact resistances bifurcate. In situ white light interferometry provides new insight on the evolution of slip-ring surfaces as a function of current ﬂow direction through the contact. Ex situ SEM of the brush ﬁber bundle surfaces shows a strong dissimilitude in the wear of contacting ﬁbers as a result of the current ﬂow direction. Steady-state friction coefﬁcients in the range of 0.20–0.25, linear wear rates of 3–5 × 10−11 m/m, and contact resistances of 0.6 m are reported for copper ﬁber brushes in water saturated carbon dioxide environments at 2.5 m/s sliding speed and up to 120 A/cm2. A bifurcation occurs at 180 A/cm2 where the electron receiving brush (positive bias) exhibits an increase in friction coefﬁcient to a range of 0.3–0.4, and the electron donating brush (negative bias) a drop to 0.18. The positive brush also exhibits an increase in wear rate to 2.3 × 10−10 m/m and a sharp decrease in contact resistance to 0.2 m . The negative brush shows an increase in wear rate but only to half the value of the positive brush, and the negative brush contact resistance increased sharply to 0.6–0.8 m . An uncertainty analysis of wear rate is presented that demonstrates the need for long (100s of km) sliding distances to achieve a reasonable measurement uncertainty for such low wear contacts.},
