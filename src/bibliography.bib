Despite extensive work, the essential physics of many of these systems is not understood and there is very little ability to make predictions in this class of materials. In this manuscript we share our personal views on the major open problems in the field of correlated electron systems. We discuss some possible routes to make progress in this rich and fascinating field. This manuscript is the result of the vigorous discussions and deliberations that took place at Johns Hopkins University during a three-day workshop January 27, 28, and 29, 2020 that brought together six senior scientists and 46 more junior scientists. Our hope, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies.},

The non-zero components of the SHG susceptibility in the ordered phase are derived from the symmetries of the susceptibility tensor in the high-temperature phase and the symmetry of the order parameter. In this derivation, the dependence of the SHG susceptibility on the order parameter follows naturally, and therefore its nonreciprocal optical properties. We examine this phenomenology for the magnetoelectric compound Cr2O3 as well as for the ferroelectromagnet YMnO3.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optical generation from a crystalline material can reveal the symmetries of both its lattice structure and underlying ordered electronic phases and can therefore be exploited as a complementary technique to diffraction based scattering probes. Although this technique has been successfully used to study the lattice and magnetic structures of systems such as semiconductor surfaces, multiferroic crystals, magnetic thin films, and multilayers, challenging technical requirements have prevented its application to the plethora of complex electronic phases found in strongly correlated electron systems. These requirements include an ability to probe small bulk single crystals at the μm length scale, a need for sensitivity to the entire nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor, oblique light incidence reflection geometry, and incident light frequency tunability among others. These measurements are further complicated by the need for extreme sample environments such as ultra low temperatures, high magnetic fields, or high pressures. In this review we present a novel experimental construction using a rotating light scattering plane that meets all the aforementioned requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by making symmetry measurements on a μm scale facet of a small bulk single crystal of Sr2IrO4 using optical second and third harmonic generation.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input ﬁles) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) deﬁning core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from ﬁrst principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We ﬁnd that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {This study examines wear phenomenon occurring in high-current density self-mated metal copper sliding contacts in humid carbon dioxide environments. A custom tribometer built to test macroscopic (lightly loaded) brush and slip-ring sliding electrical contacts at relatively high speed and current density is described in the text. Data is presented as further evidence that at some elevated current density (between 120 and 180 A/cm2) there is a transition in the wear mechanism as the brush wear rates, friction coefﬁcients, and contact resistances bifurcate. In situ white light interferometry provides new insight on the evolution of slip-ring surfaces as a function of current ﬂow direction through the contact. Ex situ SEM of the brush ﬁber bundle surfaces shows a strong dissimilitude in the wear of contacting ﬁbers as a result of the current ﬂow direction. Steady-state friction coefﬁcients in the range of 0.20–0.25, linear wear rates of 3–5 × 10−11 m/m, and contact resistances of 0.6 m are reported for copper ﬁber brushes in water saturated carbon dioxide environments at 2.5 m/s sliding speed and up to 120 A/cm2. A bifurcation occurs at 180 A/cm2 where the electron receiving brush (positive bias) exhibits an increase in friction coefﬁcient to a range of 0.3–0.4, and the electron donating brush (negative bias) a drop to 0.18. The positive brush also exhibits an increase in wear rate to 2.3 × 10−10 m/m and a sharp decrease in contact resistance to 0.2 m . The negative brush shows an increase in wear rate but only to half the value of the positive brush, and the negative brush contact resistance increased sharply to 0.6–0.8 m . An uncertainty analysis of wear rate is presented that demonstrates the need for long (100s of km) sliding distances to achieve a reasonable measurement uncertainty for such low wear contacts.},

Utilizing state-of-the-art advanced density functionals we find both the antiferromagnetic N{\textbackslash}'eel order and band gap in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. We further find that, under hydrostatic pressure, the band gap is mainly governed by magnetic correlations, whereas hybridization has a greater impact on states at higher band energies. This result suggests that CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$ is more closely related to the high-temperature superconducting cuprates and iron pnictides than the heavy fermion class of materials. Finally, we also find the antiferromagnetic CaMn\$\_2\$Bi\$\_2\$ to be topologically trivial for all pressures studied.},

	abstract = {In three different antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials we show that the magnetization dynamics of AFM compounds differs noticeably from that of ferromagnetic compounds. Optical second harmonic generation and linear reﬂection were used to monitor with a temporal resolution of {\textless}1 ps the evolution of the AFM order parameter subsequent to an intense optical excitation. Comparison of the dynamical properties of the model antiferromagnet Cr2O3 with model ferro- and ferrimagnets reveals that spin–lattice relaxation as the temporally limiting thermalization process of the magnetic subsystem is more complex and inherently faster than in compounds displaying a spontaneous magnetization. The exchange-bias compound NiO exhibits an ultrafast photoinduced AFM phase transition in the course of which the AFM order parameter is switched by 90◦. Properly timed sequences of pump pulses can repeatedly reorient the AFM order parameter within 10 ps, thus demonstrating ultrafast AFM switching. In the colossal-magnetoresistance compound Pr1−xCaxMnO3 optical pumping triggers a transition from an insulating AFM to a conducting metallic state within 230 fs.},

Combining microscopic formulation and symmetry analysis, we classify the nonlinear responses in the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{PT\}\$-symmetric systems as well as \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$-symmetric (non-magnetic) systems, and uncover nonlinear conductivity unique to the odd-parity magnetic multipole systems.

              One of the most intriguing features of some high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the interplay between one-dimensional “striped” spin order and charge order, and superconductivity.

This places stringent new constraints on our understanding of stripe order and its relation to superconductivity.},

              is widely considered to be a topological Weyl semimetal, with evidence for momentum-space monopoles of Berry curvature from transport and spectroscopic probes. As the bandstructure is highly sensitive to the magnetic order, attention has focused on anomalies in magnetization, susceptibility and transport measurements that are seen well below the Curie temperature, leading to speculation that a “hidden” phase coexists with ferromagnetism. Here we report spatially-resolved measurements by Kerr effect microscopy that identify this phase. We find that the anomalies coincide with a deep minimum in domain wall (DW) mobility, indicating a crossover between two regimes of DW propagation. We demonstrate that this crossover is a manifestation of a 2D phase transition that occurs within the DW, in which the magnetization texture changes from continuous rotation to unidirectional variation. We propose that the existence of this 2D transition deep within the ferromagnetic state of the bulk is a consequence of a giant quality factor for magnetocrystalline anisotropy unique to this compound. This work broadens the horizon of the conventional binary classification of DWs into Bloch and Néel walls, and suggests new strategies for manipulation of domain walls and their role in electron and spin transport.},

              Efficient manipulation of antiferromagnetic (AF) domains and domain walls has opened up new avenues of research towards ultrafast, high-density spintronic devices. AF domain structures are known to be sensitive to magnetoelastic effects, but the microscopic interplay of crystalline defects, strain and magnetic ordering remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal, using photoemission electron microscopy combined with scanning X-ray diffraction imaging and micromagnetic simulations, that the AF domain structure in CuMnAs thin films is dominated by nanoscale structural twin defects. We demonstrate that microtwin defects, which develop across the entire thickness of the film and terminate on the surface as characteristic lines, determine the location and orientation of 180

	abstract = {A wide variety of experimental results and theoretical investigations in recent years have convincingly demonstrated that several transition metal oxides and other materials have dominant states that are not spatially homogeneous. This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions—spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital—are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.},

Experiments utilizing femtosecond optical pulses can initiate and probe dynamics of the spin, lattice, orbital, and charge degrees of freedom. Major goals include (a) determining how interaction and competition between the relevant degrees of freedom determine macroscopic functionality in transition metal oxides (TMOs) and (b) searching for hidden phases in TMOs by controlling dynamic trajectories in a complex and pliable energy landscape. Advances in creating intense pulses from the farIR spectrum through the visible spectrum enable mode-selective excitation to facilitate exploration of these possibilities.

            The all-optical control of magnetization in thin ferromagnetic films is demonstrated.
          , 
            The interplay of light and magnetism allowed light to be used as a probe of magnetic materials. Now the focus has shifted to use polarized light to alter or manipulate magnetism. Here, we demonstrate optical control of ferromagnetic materials ranging from magnetic thin films to multilayers and even granular films being explored for ultra-high-density magnetic recording. Our finding shows that optical control of magnetic materials is a much more general phenomenon than previously assumed and may have a major impact on data memory and storage industries through the integration of optical control of ferromagnetic bits.},

Light-based augmentation of superconductivity is particularly intriguing. Copper-oxide superconductors exhibit complex interplay between spin order, charge order, and superconductivity, offering the prospect of enhanced coherence by altering the balance between competing orders. We utilize terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to monitor the c-axis Josephson plasma resonance (JPR) in La

              results in an increase of the far-infrared spectral weight by more than an order of magnitude as evidenced by a blueshift of the JPR, interpreted as resulting from nonthermal collapse of the charge order. The photoinduced signal persists well beyond our measurement window of 300 ps and exhibits signatures of spatial inhomogeneity. The electrodynamic response of this metastable state is consistent with enhanced superconducting fluctuations. Our results reveal that La

              Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is used in the study of the electronic structure of complex materials. Recently, time-resolved ARPES has become possible, where the state of the system is excited by a short “pump” pulse, and ARPES is performed using a second “probe” pulse applied after varying times.

          , 
            
              In high-temperature superconductivity, the process that leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, the fundamental charge carriers in any superconductor, remains mysterious. We used a femtosecond laser pump pulse to perturb superconducting Bi

              and studied subsequent dynamics using time- and angle-resolved photoemission and infrared reflectivity probes. Gap and quasiparticle population dynamics revealed marked dependencies on both excitation density and crystal momentum. Close to the
              d
              -wave nodes, the superconducting gap was sensitive to the pump intensity, and Cooper pairs recombined slowly. Far from the nodes, pumping affected the gap only weakly, and recombination processes were faster. These results demonstrate a new window into the dynamical processes that govern quasiparticle recombination and gap formation in cuprates.},

	abstract = {The 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 superstructure of 1T––TaSe2 at room temperature has been studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The basic structure has symmetry P 3m1 with a0 ¼ 3.4733  A and c0 ¼ 6.2715  A. The superstructure has a pseudo hexagonal lattice, but it is triclinic with a 169-fold, 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 Â 13c0 hexagonal supercell with 13 centering vectors. Structure refinements have been performed using space group P 1 and the primitive unit cell with a basal plane 131/2a0 Â 131/2a0 supercell, and with C ¼ 2a0 þ c0. Refinements converged to RF ¼ 0.086 for 2327 observed reflections. Hexagram shaped clusters of 13 Ta atoms are the principle feature of this 13-fold superstructure, in accordance with the study of Brouwer and Jellinek (Physica B 99 (1980) 51). In the present refinement, significant deviations are found from local 6/m symmetry as it was assumed by Brouwer and Jellinek. The relative phase of the superstructure on neighbouring layers represents the most favourable packing of the buckled planes of Se atoms, and elastic coupling between Se atoms of consecutive layers is identified as the driving force for the observed inter-layer shift vector 2a0. The small deviations from trigonal symmetry of the clusters are responsible for the observation of an ordered superstructure, as it is opposed to a stacking of layers according a random selection of shift vectors (2a0, 2a0 þ b0, and Àa0 À 3b0) that are equivalent by the trigonal symmetry of the basic structure.},

	abstract = {Phase transitions in 2D materials can lead to massive changes in electronic properties that enable novel electronic devices. Tantalum disulﬁde (TaS2), speciﬁcally the “1T” phase (1T-TaS2), exhibits a phase transition based on the formation of commensurate charge density waves (CCDW) at 180 K. In this work, we investigate the impact of substrate choice on the phase transitions in ultrathin 1T-TaS2. Doping and charge transfer from the substrate has little impact on CDW phase transitions. On the contrary, we demonstrated that substrate surface roughness is a primary extrinsic factor in CCDW transition temperature and hysteresis, where higher roughness leads to smaller transition hysteresis. Such roughness can be simulated via surface texturing of SiO2/Si substrates, which controllably and reproducibly induces periodic strain in the 1TTaS2 and thereby enables the potential for engineering CDW phase transitions.},

	abstract = {The band structure, density of states and anisotropic frequency-dependent optical properties have been calculated for the 1 T and 2 H phases of TaS2 and TaSe2 using the full-potential linear augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) method. In the 1 T and 2 H phases, when S is replaced by Se, the unoccupied Ta-5d and chalcogen-p bands move closer to the Fermi energy EF and the bandwidth of the chalcogen-s group decreases. Compared to the 1 T phase, in the 2 H phase the occupied/unoccupied bands move towards higher/lower energies with respect to EF. In the 1 T phase, when S is replaced by Se, the peak positions in the imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function  2ðoÞ move towards lower energies by 0.5 eV. The single peak at 6 eV in  2ðoÞ of the 1 T phase is split into two peaks in the 2 H phase. We make a detailed comparison of the frequency-dependent reﬂectivity and absorption coefﬁcient with the available experimental data. The linear mufﬁn tin orbital method within the atomic sphere approximation (LMTOASA) shows poor agreement with the experimental data while our FPLAPW results give excellent agreement with the experimental data suggesting that a better representation of the potential is essential for calculating optical properties accurately.},

	abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate abrupt, reversible switching of resistance in 1T-TaS2 using dc and pulsed sources, corresponding to an insulator-metal transition between the insulating Mott and equilibrium metallic states. This transition occurs at a constant critical resistivity of 7 mohm-cm regardless of temperature or bias conditions and the transition time is signiﬁcantly smaller than abrupt transitions by avalanche breakdown in other small gap Mott insulating materials. Furthermore, this critical resistivity corresponds to a carrier density of 4.5 × 1019 cm-3, which compares well with the critical carrier density for the commensurate to nearly commensurate charge density wave transition. These results suggest that the transition is facilitated by a carrier driven collapse of the Mott gap in 1T-TaS2, which results in fast (3 ns) switching.},

The basic models behind charge-density-wave formation in low-dimensional solids are recapitulated, the experimental and theoretical results for the three selected compounds are reviewed, and their band structures and spectral weight distributions in the commensurate charge-density-wave phases are calculated using an empirical tight-binding model. It is explored whether the origin of charge-density waves in the layered transition-metal dichalcogenides can be understood in a uniﬁed way on the basis of a few measured and calculated parameters characterizing the interacting electron–lattice system. It is found that the predictions of the standard mean-ﬁeld model agree only semi-quantitatively with the experimental data and that there is not one generally dominant factor driving charge-density-wave formation in this family of layer compounds. The need for further experimental and theoretical scrutiny is emphasized.},

This study revealed that noise in 1T-TaS2 has two pronounced maxima at the bias voltages, which correspond to the onset of CDW sliding and the NC-to-IC phase transition. We observed unusual Lorentzian features and exceptionally strong noise dependence on electric bias and temperature, leading to the conclusion that electronic noise in 2D CDW systems has a unique physical origin diﬀerent from known fundamental noise types. We argue that noise spectroscopy can serve as a useful tool for understanding electronic transport phenomena in 2D CDW materials characterized by coexistence of diﬀerent phases and strong pinning.},

We ﬁnd that for crystals with thickness larger than ≈ 10nm the transition temperatures between the diﬀerent phases as well as the hysteresis that occurs in the thermal cycle correspond to the ones expected for a bulk sample. However, when the crystals become thinner than ≈ 10nm, the commensurate CDW phase is suppressed down to the experimentally accessible temperatures. In addition, the nearly commensurate CDW phase is diminished below ≈ 4nm. These ﬁndings suggest that the interlayer coupling plays a signiﬁcant role in determining the properties of CDW systems consisting of a few unit cells in the vertical direction.},

Here, using large-area scanning tunneling microscopy we reveal an intricate chiral vortex structure and complex tiling of charged electron domains in the metastable metallic state in 1T-TaS2 created by a non-equilibrium topological transition initiated by a single femtosecond optical pulse. A Moir´e analysis shows that the interference of non-equilibrium nested Fermi surface (FS) electrons leads to the creation of charge vortices D on a length scale of ∼70 nm. On a much smaller scale of ∼ 5 nm, domain conﬁgurational patterns appear, which show bound vortex-antivortex pairs, discommensurations, domain wall (DW) crossings and DW kinks, consistent with a rapidly quenched Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Revealing the detailed mechanism for the transition leads the way to design of long-range charge-ordered metastable states with intricate emergent properties under controlled non-equilibrium conditions.},

    abstract = {Domain walls (DWs) are singularities in an ordered medium that often host exotic phenomena such as charge ordering, insulator-metal transition, or superconductivity. The ability to locally write and erase DWs is highly desirable, as it allows one to design material functionality by patterning DWs in specific configurations. We demonstrate such capability at room temperature in a charge density wave (CDW), a macroscopic condensate of electrons and phonons, in ultrathin 1T-TaS2. A single femtosecond light pulse is shown to locally inject or remove mirror DWs in the CDW condensate, with probabilities tunable by pulse energy and temperature. Using time-resolved electron diffraction, we are able to simultaneously track anti-synchronized CDW amplitude oscillations from both the lattice and the condensate, where photoinjected DWs lead to a red-shifted frequency. Our demonstration of reversible DW manipulation may pave new ways for engineering correlated material systems with light.},

Crystals of such materials can be cleaved down to less than 1000 {\textasciitilde} and are then transparent in the region of direct band-to-band transitions. The transmission spectra of the family have been correlated group by group with the wide range of electrical and structural data available to yield useful working band models that are in accord with a molecular orbital approach. Several special topics have arisen ; these include exciton screening, d-band formation, and the metal/insulator transition; also magnetism and superconductivity in such compounds. High pressure work seems to offer the possibility for testing the recent theory of excitonlc insulators.},

abstract = {We describe a novel scheme of detecting rotational anisotropy-second harmonic generation (RA-SHG) signals using a lock-in amplifier referenced to a fast scanning RASHG apparatus. The method directly measures the nth harmonics of the scanning frequency corresponding to SHG signal components of Cn symmetry that appear in a Fourier series expansion of a general RA-SHG signal. GaAs was used as a test sample allowing comparison of point-by-point averaging with the lock-in based method. When divided by the C\&\#x0221E; signal component, the lock-in detected data allowed for both self-referenced determination of ratios of Cn components of up to 1 part in 104 and significantly more sensitive measurement of the relative amount of different Cn components when compared with conventional methods.},
