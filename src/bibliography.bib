            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

This interplay has been the subject of a very successful European Science Foundation (ESF) programme entitled COSLAB (‘Cosmology in the Laboratory’) that ran from 2001 to 2006, itself built on an earlier ESF network called TOPDEF (‘Topological Defects: Non-equilibrium Field Theory in Particle Physics, Condensed Matter and Cosmology’). The articles presented in this issue of

The non-zero components of the SHG susceptibility in the ordered phase are derived from the symmetries of the susceptibility tensor in the high-temperature phase and the symmetry of the order parameter. In this derivation, the dependence of the SHG susceptibility on the order parameter follows naturally, and therefore its nonreciprocal optical properties. We examine this phenomenology for the magnetoelectric compound Cr2O3 as well as for the ferroelectromagnet YMnO3.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optical generation from a crystalline material can reveal the symmetries of both its lattice structure and underlying ordered electronic phases and can therefore be exploited as a complementary technique to diffraction based scattering probes. Although this technique has been successfully used to study the lattice and magnetic structures of systems such as semiconductor surfaces, multiferroic crystals, magnetic thin films, and multilayers, challenging technical requirements have prevented its application to the plethora of complex electronic phases found in strongly correlated electron systems. These requirements include an ability to probe small bulk single crystals at the μm length scale, a need for sensitivity to the entire nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor, oblique light incidence reflection geometry, and incident light frequency tunability among others. These measurements are further complicated by the need for extreme sample environments such as ultra low temperatures, high magnetic fields, or high pressures. In this review we present a novel experimental construction using a rotating light scattering plane that meets all the aforementioned requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by making symmetry measurements on a μm scale facet of a small bulk single crystal of Sr2IrO4 using optical second and third harmonic generation.},

	abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input ﬁles) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) deﬁning core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from ﬁrst principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We ﬁnd that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.wear.2009.08.036},
	abstract = {This study examines wear phenomenon occurring in high-current density self-mated metal copper sliding contacts in humid carbon dioxide environments. A custom tribometer built to test macroscopic (lightly loaded) brush and slip-ring sliding electrical contacts at relatively high speed and current density is described in the text. Data is presented as further evidence that at some elevated current density (between 120 and 180 A/cm2) there is a transition in the wear mechanism as the brush wear rates, friction coefﬁcients, and contact resistances bifurcate. In situ white light interferometry provides new insight on the evolution of slip-ring surfaces as a function of current ﬂow direction through the contact. Ex situ SEM of the brush ﬁber bundle surfaces shows a strong dissimilitude in the wear of contacting ﬁbers as a result of the current ﬂow direction. Steady-state friction coefﬁcients in the range of 0.20–0.25, linear wear rates of 3–5 × 10−11 m/m, and contact resistances of 0.6 m are reported for copper ﬁber brushes in water saturated carbon dioxide environments at 2.5 m/s sliding speed and up to 120 A/cm2. A bifurcation occurs at 180 A/cm2 where the electron receiving brush (positive bias) exhibits an increase in friction coefﬁcient to a range of 0.3–0.4, and the electron donating brush (negative bias) a drop to 0.18. The positive brush also exhibits an increase in wear rate to 2.3 × 10−10 m/m and a sharp decrease in contact resistance to 0.2 m . The negative brush shows an increase in wear rate but only to half the value of the positive brush, and the negative brush contact resistance increased sharply to 0.6–0.8 m . An uncertainty analysis of wear rate is presented that demonstrates the need for long (100s of km) sliding distances to achieve a reasonable measurement uncertainty for such low wear contacts.},
